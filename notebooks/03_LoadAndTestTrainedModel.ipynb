The food didn\\'t take too long to come out for all of us but when I received my side of eggs, they literally looked like they had been sitting under the heat lamp for an hour or so. It was gross, and as soon as I had one bite of it I knew I needed to say something. I got Paul\\'s attention and I told him about the issue also explaining that I\\'ll just order a Denver Omelet instead (especially because I had a large appetite that morning). He looked at me with a funky look and said \\\\\"all for you?\\\\\" That made me feel a little uncomfortable as if he was judging me or my habits. Obviously it\\'s for me! I few minutes go by and he brings out a side of freshly cooked eggs. I was confused as to why he brought it out and I mentioned that I thought I was just getting the Denver Omelet and no side of eggs. He basically ignored what I was saying and told me that the eggs were fresh and hot. So, now I\\'m forced to eat these eggs which in turn made me less hungry for the Denver Omlelet which was coming out in a few minutes. Paul is a good guy, but he\\'s a little too intense at the table with customers. He must\\'ve reminded our table about 10 times that we should take tequila shots. It was funny the first few times but after a while it got old.',\n",

We also ordered the pretzles, but i never got to even taste them, devoured before I had a chance. The waitress, Ally according to my receipt, was not very attentive. My drink never got refilled once, husband had an Oberon, glass was empty, never stopped or asked if we wanted another. My daughter did get a refill. I was drinking tea, she had coke. There was a guy walking back and forth all night inside to outside, I am guessing the manager. He was a tall black guy,I stopped him at one point and asked for a to go box for the burger for our dogs. No one ever came over to ask how was everything, they seemed very understaffed.

Now as a restaurant let's get this straight, it's basic, it's not artistically decorated, it's a clean basic food joint and they have an alright selection of taiwanese style boba although their taro boba is actually pretty good since it's not too sweet. There are 3 items I tend to order at Taiwan Food Express and that is the Beef Roll, the pork sticky rice, and the Pork Shank soup. The Beef Roll reminds me of a Malaysian Beef curry roll eventhough this one doesn't have curry, the pastry has a similar consistency to Malaysian roti but with the beef in it mmmmm it's greasy and YUMMY. The pork stick rice is usual dim sum fare but I like it better than the sticky rice at Great Wall dim sum in PHX. and the Pork Shank noodle soup brings out the Asian in me, it's good ol shank with a kinda salty soup with bok choy in it.

One of the Assembly Line workers actually gave me a complimentary 6\\\\\" diameter Wheat Tortilla just to try! Definitely not a crispy exterior. The Tortilla is a very good alternative to the traditional Flour Tortilla made with Lard... which I still prefer!  But, if I\\'m in Las Vegas... why not?

We got told the club was at capacity and would have to wait 5 hours for even a chance of getting in. Wet Republic opens at 11am and we got there around 1/1.30pm so we decided to try again on Sunday 6th to see Tiesto.\\\\nThe next time was perfect! We arrived at 10.45am (we stayed at MGM so we were allowed to access the pool early), queued up and got in with minimal wait time and no issues. We found a little spot on the side of the pool and we stayed there all day, taking it in turns to mind our belongings.

As far as keeping our drinks filled they did great, which we needed because......it was an hour before we saw our entrees (and this is being generous.)\\\\n\\\\n     Once we noticed, without a doubt, that people who arrived after us were receiving their food before us, my friend asked about our orders.  Our waitress replied that \\\\\"it should only be another 3 to 5 minutes,\\\\\" but she would go check.  (How she would know 3-5 minutes before she went to look is beyond me, but I digress.)  She comes back and says they\\'re plating it now, it will be out soon. Our  food did come at this point, and like I said, we all loved our food.  \\\\n\\\\n     The waitress brought our check without us having to ask for it - that was good.  There were 4 of us, and we were all paying for our own meal, so it was split payment between cash and credit.  There was more than enough to cover the bill, because like I said, we were each paying our own meal.  I told her to charge my card first and for how much, and to use the cash after.  She walks away and we see her go to the computer for a while, then she disappears for another 5 minutes (again, generous).  When she returns, I open the folder and the only thing in there is my card and the slip for me to sign.  I\\'m clearly puzzled, because I knew we had change coming back.  She probably notices because she says...... wait for it......\\\\n\\\\n\\\\\"You guys didn\\'t want change did you?\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\n     Ex-cah-use me?   She seriously tipped herself.  I\\'ve heard of (and experienced) automatically billed tips for large parties, but a) we were a party of four, b) this was not on the bill, and c) none of us have ever had a waiter or waitress just keep the change unless we said to.  Is this what gets done to tourist?   \\\\n\\\\n     She starts to walk away before any of us even reply, so I say \\\\\"Hold on.\\\\\"  My friend asks her how much change there was and she says \\\\\"Oh I\\'m not sure let me look\\\\\"  What?  Yes, you are sure - or maybe this is something you do all the time so it\\'s hard for you to keep track.  \\\\n\\\\n     Just so you know Magdalene, since apparently you are not aware, it is up to the patron to decide how much and IF they tip you, not for you to decide based on how you think you did.  We would have tipped you, but based on principle - you do not make the choice to keep someone\\'s money and ask questions later.  What you did was extremely rude.  We probably would have tipped you even more than you took,  so thanks for taking it upon yourself to reward yourself.  It saved us some money.',\n",

       "        \"I have been going to a genius stylist for about 5 years now, but she's been traveling so much recently that I was forced to see someone new for my last appointment.  I've driven past Etch at Kierland Commons dozens of times, and have recently had a couple of friends try them out with fairly decent results. I prefer to have my hair colored and cut by the same person, and they were happy to accommodate. However, I believe that they normally schedule a separate stylist, colorist, assistant, etc.  My appointment was with Janine, who had her work cut out for her when I went in - my hair was about 8 inches longer than it needed to be and my roots had started taking over. I was a little nervous to have my long hair cut drastically short by someone I hadn't been to before, but she did a fantastic job, and did so with very little instruction/guidance. The color was perfect and I couldn't have asked for a better cut. I really enjoyed the salon. It is clean, edgy and appears to have all of the latest and greatest hair styling toys. The entire experience ran me $170, which is more than i typically pay, but I think it is a competitive price for the area. The salon is open late and on weekends, which is very convenient. I will definitely return. \\\\n**I should also mention that another friend of mine, Fuzzy (called that because of his fuzzy hair), who has had his hair cut by the same barber since he was 6 years old, was recently given an extreme-hair-makeover by Ryan.  Ryan not only proved his genius status by seriously updating his look, but was very friendly along the way and patiently showed Fuzzy how to keep up his style after he left the salon. Great experiences all-around.\",\n",

       "        \"Eh, its a big store full of pre packaged pool care items so the products are fine, but for the love of all things good and holy please go to another Leslie's to buy your backyard water hole supplies!  The customer service at this place is astounding, and not in the gives you warm fuzzies way.  The sales folk will flat out lie to you about the products they sell either out of commission lust or utter bewilderment about the items in the store and how they work.  I recently went in to buy a $200+ piece of equipment with one and only one question: Does this unit have parts that I will need to replace at certain time intervals (ie every year) and was assured up and down with a little tap dance that no Ma'am, the price you pay now is all you'll pay for this lovely thing, it slices, it dices, it makes Julian eggo margaritas!  Well when I get the thing home the manual states that I can expect $50 a year in replacement proprietary battery packs and sensors, but the thing was written in English and not slimy sales-ees so perhaps he just thought the included paper was a napkin and wiped his drool with it rather than actually reading it.  Against my better judgement I go back today for some chemicals and ended up leaving with nothing except a vague feeling I should be glad I wasn't sent to my room.  After wandering the store for about 10 minutes and watching the clerk watch tv in the back I finally find half of what I'm looking for and pace back and forth in front of his hideout hoping he'll get the hint and ring me up.  When he finally glances up he makes the mistake of asking if I need anything else... and hey I do, so what better time to speak up!  I tell him I need some pool conditioner, and he suggests I bring in a water sample.  While the store is not infested with roaches or naked babies or drug cartel mafia it's still not exactly what I'd call my type of hangout, and if I can avoid spending my free time chumming it up at Leslie's I'd like to, so I let him know I'd just like to know where they keep the stuff.  Still, with a strong father knows best Daddy Pool Pro tells me I'm not quite ready for that information and he'll tell me what I need to know when I'm older (and bring in a water sample).  I've always heard that the third time is a charm so I give it another go, this time relenting that a poor misinformed lass like myself probably shouldn't buy this product I came in to buy, but golly gee I sure would at least like to know the name of the stuff so maybe when I'm not barefoot in the kitchen I can learn me some about it.  Luckily my weakness for knowledge was detected by my hero and Daddy swooped in to save the day again with the reassurance in his voice almost as palpable as a patronizing pat on the head. No No dear, Don't worry your pretty little head about it.  At that point I told dad I didnt need to borrow the car that night, and he could expect to be put in a cheap retirement home in mexico for his golden years. ;)  Really tho folks, treating your paying customers like children and withholding information about your products is the quickest way to bolster your database of ex-customers.  It would help if your employees knew a bit about the products they sell and didn't overtly lie to make a quick buck, but with service like this place has I'm guessing they have a lot more to worry about.\",\n",

Here, they serve it with their Hollandaise sauce, which isn't quite right, ask to substitute their brown mushroom gravy instead, and that is the best way to undo any healthy diet you may be trying.  The Chief of Staff tried their biscuits and gravy which was okay, I think the way to go here is poutine plus Guinness on draught (is there really any other way?).

Like the carnival barker while on-line shopping for the best cost effective flight, the pricing of the ticket and the promise from their website(the barker) of a great airline providing low cost air travel turned out to be a joke.  Once the ticket is purchased I find out I now must pay $40.00 for my luggage each way.  That's $80.00 more Bucks!!!  The Barker tells me to join their fan club for $59.95 and save$10.00 both ways.  Not hardly, that's $39.95 added on top of the $30.00 I still have to pay,thus luggage will cost $99.95 to go with me.  Oh, and if you wait until you get to the airport to handle your luggage it's even more.  As I boarded the plane I was pleased to see a clean new plane.  That was however, my last pleasing experience.  The seats do not recline, your squeezed into seats too close together, and they charge you for everything you can possibly think of.  Water was $3.00!  Needless to say I refuse to pay for water at restaurants and airplanes.  I didn't go to the restroom on the plane so I can't tell you if they were charging a fee to enter or if you had to buy paper.  I can tell you I will never consider them again.  I ended up paying more than I would have on two other airlines...my fault.  Unless, your next flight is very short and you will be in the uncomfortable seats for less than 30 minutes, no price savings is worth and the price savings does not exist.\",\n",

I'm not complaining, high five to more options.\\\\n\\\\nSo Shoku is owned by Bachi Burger who are RIGHT next door and if you don't know are a trendy joint that specialize in gourmet burgers with an Asian twist, so one should assume that applies to the ramen restaurant as well. \\\\n\\\\nFirst and foremost Shoku definitely makes the prettiest ramen, it has a nice contrast of colors and as far as I know the only restaurant to use black garlic oil (*EDIT* never mind Fukumimi uses BGO). I'm not an advocate of food being true to style, but the flavors I tasted in the Buta-San Ramen were strange. The menma or bamboo shoots were really sweet as were the (berkshire?) pork loin slices, and pork belly. So if you are like me who likes to eat each component individually, its going to be weird. I have to be honest the broth didn't have much depth even though its tonkotsu based although definitely saw the fat floating on top, if anything the black garlic oil was the most dominant flavor in the broth. Noodles can be ordered firm (normally how they always come) and soft, but soft noodles sounds weird, you lose the nice bite component. Hate to be an McKayla Maroney, but overall I wasn't too impressed. \\\\n\\\\nService was great though, came to our table often, refilled water, etc etc. \\\\n\\\\nI'm down to still give it another go, but this being on the complete other side of Vegas for me, I won't be in a hurry.\",\n",

       "        \"It's hard to put into words the experience I got from staying at the Cosmo, but I will try to do my best and make it as short and sweet as possible!! I can easily say that this was the best room I have ever had... or will have in a long, long time! I booked through Lasvegas.com for a 3 night stay at a Studio Terrace room. When we were checking in, the AWESOME guy who was helping us, asked if we would like an upgrade on the studio terrace with a view of the Bellagio Fountains for $25/per night. THE BEST $75 I HAVE EVER SPENT...!!! Seriously... we didn't want to leave our room. You also get a free, small bottle of water which is nice of them, but then again, this hotel can def afford it. \\\\n\\\\nAnyway, our studio was amazing in every way possible. There is a huge bathroom, with a shower, soaking tub, and a separate toilet room. There is also a living room with a couch/desk, and the bedroom that is connected to the balcony. Everything is connected to a remote, so from turning on and off the lights to the XM radio on both flat screen TVs. Just one pointer i have to make, and we were def warned about this, but i am not sure how seriously we took him. The minibar/food in the room is all wired, so even if you move the food just a bit, the hotel may charge you right away. We were just messing around, looking through what we got and trying to find room for the food I brought from home, and i was immediately changed $75. Not exactly sure what the $75 was for, but all the food/drinks are hella expensive in the room. Anyway, we called the front desk right away and they removed the charges almost immediately, so the customer service we had at the hotel was great. \\\\n\\\\nLike I said, our first night we were really tired and the view was so amazing, that we didn't want to leave. We ended up ordering room service which was brought to us hot and fresh within 30 minutes. The guy bringing the food even gave us a couple extra items for free, so nice touch :) We were starving, but the food was excellent and I was incredibly happy with our entire experience to that point. \\\\n\\\\nThe hotel itself is jaw dropping gorgeous... it's hard to put in words exactly everything it has to offer, but it's def a site to see. I can't comment on the casino since I don't really gamble, but I would probably recommend to go elsewhere to play. I don't think this hotel's main focus is on gambling, especially since I overheard that it's the only hotel that has a straight path from one side to the other, so people don't get mixed up at the slot machines/tables. We didn't get a chance to check out any of the pools because it was too cold, but I cannot wait to be back and party at the Marquee Day club. Speaking of Marquee, it was def a HUGE plus that all we had to do is take the elevator down to the club, but I really did not like the club at all - i have a separate review for Marquee. \\\\n\\\\nAs for food, when I was in Vegas two years ago, my family and I dined at Comme Ca and it was delicious from what I can remember.  Besides room service, i briefly checked out Holstein's and ordered food to go before a night out in Marquee. I ended up ordering the wrong thing though, and though it was good, I was disappointed. But I will def be back to this burger bar next time because the menu is insane! At 5 am, we decided to go check out Secret Pizza, but also to our disappointment, they were already closing. So, I def have a list of things to eat next time I am there. \\\\n\\\\nCosmo's location is absolutely perfect - right smack in the middle of the strip. It's very easy to get to other hotels from there and there a couple Walgreens/CVS very close as well. \\\\n\\\\nI am still in awe of this hotel, and I truly cannot wait to come back and experience it all over again.

I absolutely love MORTON'S and was excited to try out SHe.\\\\n\\\\nThe d\\\\u00e9cor and layout is quite appealing. Very Vegas, as it should be. The concept of the mini catwalks and stages presented a unique attraction to the venue. The model's and dancers were very attractive and talented, but overall theme was very, should I say, abstract!?\\\\n\\\\nVENUE: I couldn't quite tell what the target demographic was. It looked trendy, as if to appeal to mid 20- 40's ... but the choice of music appealed to mid 40's - up. I felt the choice of music was misplaced. But as I looked around, the crowd was an older crowd as well. (I had dinner with girlfriends on a Sunday Night)\\\\n\\\\nSERVICE: It was not to Morton's standard. I felt neglected by my server, although the service staff provided bread and water frequently. The menu knowledge of the server was lacking. Questions were not answered confidently and I was mislead to how the plates were served.\\\\n\\\\nTraditionally, Morton's is A la carte, and I was told this place was the same. It is not. The plates are accompanied with complimentary items (which is nice). But, I was convinced to purchase much more than I wanted to eat. Don't get me wrong, it was a pleasure to try a little bit of everything, but as we know, it's a pricy place to dine.\\\\n\\\\nFOOD: Was delicious. It met my expectations.

A minute later a huge plate of cubed goat and a side salad with Italian dressing comes out and lands in front of me.  I say cubed goat because that\\'s was happened to this poor beastie.  The meat consisted of apparently random 2-3 inch cubed chunks of goat ribs and legs complete with attached tendons, a couple of arteries, some fat, muscle meat (steak) and so on. It tasted GREAT! Seasoned well, and grilled with seasoned onions too.\\\\n\\\\nThe other customers - As I was eating my rice, salad and goat with just my right hand, more of the regular clientele came in and looked universally stunned to see me there. When they looked down, saw that I was eating with just my right hand in the same Arab manner as them, in mere seconds they accepted me as just another diner at lunchtime. It was actually really cool to see the waryness and prejudice on their faces evaporate in seconds to be replaced by acceptance.\\\\n\\\\nWould I go there again - heck yeah!

Taco Bell may win on price, but this place wins on value (since you're, you know, getting food and what not instead of, well, Taco Bell).\\\\n\\\\nIf you're not going the $5 veggie route, it loses a bit of it's appeal since a lot of the other stuff can get up there in price.  I've tried other things, though, and they've all been good so far.  The meat, when I get it, is usually very fresh (they grill it right there).\\\\n\\\\nOh, and I know this is weird, but I like their packaging.  The pita's are wrapped in a handy two-piece wrapper.

It also makes it easily to walk with it if you're in a real hurry.\\\\n\\\\nAll in all, not a bad choice on-campus.  It's a good meal at a good price, and way healthier than pizza or burgers.  Don't make a trip to the Tempe Campus for it, but if you need something while you're already there, you can't go wrong at the unfortunately named Extreme Pita.\",\n",

I can\\'t remember the last time I had an experience this bad at a restaurant in the Valley. It was Saturday night and there were only a few people at the bar and a table full of very drunk and very loud college football fans. \\\\n     We  sat down and ordered a round of drinks and our meals. They have a decent selection of draft beers and cocktails. My friend ordered an italian greyhound and it was just okay. The menu stated the drink had basil in it and it did, but for 9 dollars and for a \\\\\"speciality\\\\\" drink one would expect a muddle of fresh basil, not a few shakes of dried basil from a jar. After awhile we realized we had waited almost 45 minutes and our food still had not arrived. The table of college football fans had barely just gotten their food. So we waited, the server came over and told us there was a backup in the kitchen and our food would be out soon. So we waited more, not a single plate was coming out of the kitchen. We waited a little more, after about an hour of waiting our food came. I had the jalapeno burger, my husband the cioppino, my friend the short ribs.\\\\n    The food was OK, my burger was good, but not definitely not worth the wait. My husband said the seafood in his cioppino was good, but the tomato sauce was really bland and took away from the dish. My friends short ribs looked really sad, she said they were tender but lacked flavor, there was no sauce and the dish was really flat. Her veggies were practically raw. Definitely not worth the 20 dollar price tag. \\\\n  When the server brought our food she acknowledge the long wait and said she notified the owner, who has been sitting at the bar all night. She let us know she was trying to get him to offer a free dessert. Gee, how generous. The biggest disappointment was that the owner/manager never came to speak to us or apologize. He sat at the bar. I understand things happen, but show some professionalism, show your customers you care about their experience. \\\\n   When the server came to clear our plate she let us know if we wanted dessert it would be on the house, almost a non-gesture since the last thing we wanted to do was wait some more. She brought our check and i was taken back by the 82 dollars total. Charging 7 bucks each for a draft beer, wow.\\\\n  I really wanted to like this place, it is in such a nice space and has good atmosphere.

To me they are the first people you encounter when going to a doctor for the first time. JMO those at the front desk should be welcoming. You do not know how people are feeling when going to see a doctor. Empathy is truly one of the keys to health care and customer service in general. Is it that hard to even just say hello. How are you today? Make the patient feel like they are going to be treated with respect. When you are just handed a clip board, not even a pen?? Well then I say I am nothing more than a dollar in someone's pocket. I sat there thinking will I get great care from the doctor? I was unsure.   \\\\nThen I met the assistant to the doctor. That was one of the most unpleasant experiences I have ever had. She could not even crack a smile. I could tell she could not wait to get out of the room. And I could not wait for her to leave. At this point I was ready to call it a day and go to quick care. But I came this far. I had to give the doctor a chance. My mom loved him? \\\\nThe doctor came in a few minutes later. He was friendly. He asked questions. He did the exam. He was thorough. I did find him a little condescending as I cannot pronounce a medical diagnosis. He made sure to correct me and not in a nice way. \\\\nHe advised me as to what to do. \\\\nHe told me if I need to come back for  additional treatment to do so. \\\\nWill I? Not sure.

The dishes on the special were their Uni Tomato Cream Pasta and their Squid Ink Spaghetti.  A  Japanese Italian fused restaurant... of course I called right away and booked a reservation.\\\\n\\\\nMy party of 2 had a reservation at 9 and when we got there our table was ready and waiting for us.  The restaurant is on the small side and because of their specials every seated was filled.  So I'm super happy that I made the reservation.  \\\\n\\\\nWe started our meal with two of their appetizers\\\\n\\\\nA small order of their Fried Oysters - They come out really hot so be careful.  The batter was nice and crispy and the oysters were perfectly cooked on the inside.  Their tartar sauce really unnecessary, but it wasn't bad if you like it.  \\\\n\\\\nTheir Balsamic Soft Shell Crab - I think they should rename it to Garlic Balsamic Soft Shell Crab because there is a very healthy portion of Garlic in this dish.  To me that is a great thing because I love garlic.  The crab was cook beautifully and tasted great, I only wish it was bigger, but what can you do.\\\\n\\\\nNow onto the main courses:\\\\n\\\\nSquid Ink Spaghetti - This dish was different and fun to order.  The squid ink could be tasted in what I think was a white clam sauce.  I thought it was a good dish, but it does have one drawback.  The squid ink stains your whole mouth black while you are eating it.  So be sure you are ordering with someone you are comfortable with and a first date.  \\\\n\\\\nUnit Tomato Cream Pasta - This was so clearly the star of the meal.  It was amazing!  The sauce was creamy and delicious.  You could clearly see the many pieces of Uni in your pasta.  I would have never guess to put those flavors together, but I was amazing.

       "        \"Valley Metro used to offer student passes to my college. This summer they got greedy and failed to make a deal with my school. So if I bought their summer semester pass it would cost $40 more than if I just paid full-fare every day. Taking advantage of full time students who have no income is just as shameful as preying on the elderly on fixed income.  SHAME ON VALLEY METRO.\\\\n\\\\nValley Metro used to be a convenient way to read on my way to class in the morning. Then they made the trains shorter with only 2 cars instead of three. Now there are more people paying full fare to ride the train, but they haven't increased capacity, so everyone has to stand all day long. They say they aren't making enough money to run more trains; but more people are paying full fare than there was before (it's a hallow excuse). SHAME ON VALLEY METRO.\\\\n\\\\nValley Metro devised a system to pay for your ride by pre-paid train passes, but if you forget to activate your pass outside the train as you're running to catch the train you could get a $500 ticket. Just to re-cap; even though you've already bought your pass in advance you can still get a $500 ticket! -That's a ridiculous system.  They could have allowed us to validate our tickets on the train in case we're running late...but no, it's better to hassle people on the train with their lame security detail (Gestapo); who get their jolleys interrogating average people.  SHAME ON VALLEY METRO.\\\\n\\\\nThe sign says it takes a half hour to go from Tempe to Phoenix on the light rail. That's complete and total hog-wash; no matter what time of day it is. I live 1 mile from the train station, on an average day I expect to spend 1.5 hours each way on my commute. It's a 55-65 minute train-commute into Phoenix from Mill Ave to Indian School. Add on the fact that  I usually wait at the platform for about 10 minutes, because even though they are supposed to come every 10 minutes, they never do. Then add, because the intersection is a gauntlet at Indian School (because of the train station is in the middle of Central ave, instead of one side or the other) it takes me another 10 minutes to get from the train to my building across the street. Why? -poor planning. SHAME ON VALLEY METRO.\\\\n\\\\nThen there are times where the trains are overloaded, but they don't send 3 car trains to fit all the people. Examples: Central High School lets out the same time every day and 300 kids flood the train. Baseball games downtown, cause a flood of the train. When there's an expo downtown I can't get on the train in the morning, because it's too full, the trains run slower and I'm late for my 8:30am class (when I leave at 7am!). Valley Metro fails to consider it's environment. SHAME ON VALLEY METRO.\\\\n\\\\nNO I'm not thankful of having a train that hardly goes anywhere and costs too much. BETTER transit is everywhere (except LA).   BART has been in San Francisco for years and is cleaner, nicer and cheaper. You only pay for as far as you ride. So you only pay for what space you actually use. If you go one stop everyday, it's not expensive at all. The Buses in Seattle run clean on electric lines on some streets and are much more efficient than anything we use in AZ. In Sydney, the buses are more efficient because they run the traffic lights so the buses don't have to stop at them. The Valley Metro system is lame and costs too much. SHAME ON VALLEY METRO.\\\\n\\\\nIt's our own fault for voting for people who pass useless laws and can't balance a budget to save their lives. AZ has been putting mass transit on the back burner for decades. If you want more tax dollars, get the working class to work on time efficiently. SHAME ON THE AZ VOTERS AND VALLEY METRO.\\\\n\\\\nALSO the light rail could prevent people from driving drunk, by operating just a little later. If the trains operated until 3am, all the patrons of Tempe and downtown Phoenix night life could get home safe no worries. Instead we pay (taxpayer $) for expensive DUI checkpoints. It's a simpler solution that's more efficient and will encourage patronage of local businesses. Keep the train on later so it's useful and PREVENTS crime.

Since I'm not a big fan of balsamic, which I think is too sweet, I liberally sprinkled my dipping mixture with salt to cut the sweetness.  The bread was fresh and tasty.\\\\n\\\\nI ordered the lobster bisque for an appetizer.  It had a lobster flavor but there were no pieces of lobster to be found.  There were two ravioli on the bottom of the bowl that may have had some type of ground lobster filling but there was no flavor of lobster from the ravioli.\\\\n\\\\nFor the main course, I ordered the New York strip steak and frites.  I also ordered a side of wilted spinach.  I ordered the steak black and blue and I specified extra rare.  The meat was done more than that but it was acceptable.  I wish they'd just do black and blue.  You can't un-cook meat but you can heat it some more if it's too rare.  The steak was a bit tough to cut, but it was OK to eat.  Perhaps they need better steak knives?  The spinach came with lots of freshly sliced garlic and was very good.\\\\n\\\\nFor dessert, I ordered the cr\\\\u00e8me br\\\\u00fbl\\\\u00e9e.  It was different than I've had before.  My server told me to make sure I spooned to the bottom.  This br\\\\u00fbl\\\\u00e9e had a layer of semi-sweet chocolate on the bottom and then the vanilla bean cr\\\\u00e8me with the glazed top.  There were some blueberries and a 1/2 strawberry on top.  Dessert was very good.\\\\n\\\\nService was very good.  My server, Frank and his bus person, Umberto, were on top of things.  Iced tea was refilled without asking and Frank came often to check on how I was doing and to see if I needed anything.  I was greeted promptly at the podium and the woman asked me if I had any comp, coupon, Groupon or anything else like that.  When I said Groupon, she told me to make sure I showed it to the server.\\\\n\\\\nAt the end of the meal, Frank asked me if I would take a short survey they were doing.  There were at most 10 questions with an excellent to poor scale to rate various aspects of dining at Le Proven\\\\u00e7al.  It was actually a 32 gb iPod in a large case so you didn't pocket it and walk out the door.\\\\n\\\\nThe restaurant is a little pricey.

       "        'All right, I\\' am sure I am going to catch some flak over this review, so let me just say read through to the end before passing judgement. I\\'ve been to The Old Fashioned twice and while my meals have been good, it hasn\\'t been anything to shout about. Maybe I\\'m ordering wrong, or my expectations are too high.\\\\n\\\\nThe first time was on an early Saturday afternoon around 3pm. There was no wait, but it was fairly crowded nonetheless and we sat at the bar. I had the beer cheese soup and the spinach salad with hot bacon dressing. The salad was large but a touch out of balance; it sort of felt like a big pile of spinach. In addition, it was delivered with no dressing and took well over 5 minutes to flag down a server to get it. The soup was great in flavor and thickness but I found the popcorn garnish a touch contrived and honestly distracting in flavor; oyster crackers would be better. Maybe I should have just asked?  (Aside: I don\\'t recall what my companion had.)\\\\n\\\\nThe second time was on a busy Sunday evening, and I went specifically to get the Scandinavian roast chicken special since it sounded so original on my first visit. I\\'d say it was a bit of a let down. We started with the cheese curds and they\\'re a little salty, but easily the best I\\'ve had. Great stuff, particularly the dipping sauce that came with. The smashed red bliss potatoes were good and the gravy flavorful. Accompanying roasted carrots and parsnips were great.The sausage currant dressing was wet enough to have been stuffing (I am not sure it it was cooked in the bird or in a dish) and splashed with a good ladle of gravy. It was ok; the sausage and currant flavors were mild and I think those flavors could have been more assertive. The chicken was a good portion but if the menu didn\\'t tell me the spices I would not have known. It was supposed to be cardamom, cinnamon and juniper which are all strong flavors but they were unnoticeable in the meat and barely noticeable on the skin. The skin itself was not crisp at all and perhaps a little oily; the flesh of the bird a touch greasy. Maybe they\\'re using some kind of organic / local bird and I\\'m not used to it? I almost felt it was a capon rather than a chicken. Hrm.\\\\n\\\\nMy partner on the second visit had the salmon salad with tarragon vinagrette. I got to sample that and thought it was excellent, with crispy bacon, cold poached salmon and finely sliced red onions over mixed greens. There may have been some pecans, but I do not believe my bites had any. The tarragon vinaigrette was spot-on in flavor and surprisingly thick; it makes me think of cold Bearnaise in both appearance and richness. It seems unlikely, but I would definitely recommend this dish.\\\\n\\\\nDessert was a brownie served with grasshopper ice cream separately and we shared both. The brownie itself was nothing to write home about but the ice cream came drizzled with creme de menthe and was very good.\\\\n\\\\nAs I said at the start, I think I\\'m just not choosing wisely here. Alternatively, perhaps I\\'m used to non-jazzed-up versions of these things at real supper clubs up in the northwoods and am a little put off by a quasi-hip reinvention. I suppose I\\'m going to have to try the burgers, which all look fabulous. Prices seem remarkably good across the board now that I think about it. They could probably raise prices a buck across the board and it would still be a good value. I\\'m going to give it another go and see what happens.\\\\n\\\\nCocktails: \\\\nVisit 1: Brandy Old Fashioned, sour. Good, flavorful, strong.\\\\nVisit 2: Brand Old Fashioned, \\\\\"press\\\\\" (soda and sprite). Not as good; weaker in both alcohol and flavors. I blame the soda. Stick to the classics, right? =)\\\\n\\\\nOne final note: I\\'m a modern guy and sometimes fail to carry cash; it\\'s 2012, you know? So I got a drink at the bar my companion simply wanted water. I asked to have it placed on my dinner tab. I was told they don\\'t do that here. Ok, no problem, here\\'s my card, just charge it. I was told there\\'s a $10 minimum for a charge. It\\'s not the bartender\\'s fault those policies were in effect, but perhaps when the hostess indicates you can wait for your table at the bar she should mention these (frankly ridiculous) policies. I was pretty embarrassed in front of the woman I was dining with. While I really should have had some cash on me -- I was running late and it was pouring rain so I missed going to the ATM, so I\\'m partially at fault -- it still doesn\\'t excuse it.',\n",

It takes balls to charge $10 for a glass of $7 \\\\\"sparkling\\\\\" wine(Zardetto Veneto)! Or $15 for a glass of house wine that\\'s worth $18 a bottle(Abbazia di Novacello)...Their \\\\\"better\\\\\" selections aren\\'t really all that much better, $42 for a glass of $70 wine(Brigaldara Amarone della Valpolicella Classico DOCG)... But as usual, they get away with it because the majority of people are not familiar with wines. I\\'m not singling Bartolotta out on this, almost all restaurants and even wine bars, do it.\\\\n\\\\n I also think the whole gimmick of having people buy an entire fish is ridiculous. You\\'re looking at $200 or more for a fish that was caught in some of Europe\\'s dirtiest waters.... although they\\'ve made a lot of strides over the last decade...  \\\\n\\\\nAnd...I also wouldn\\'t recommend the tasting menu, here or anywhere else...namely for the fact that when I go out to eat, I want a meal...and a tasting menu is...

The Tuscan ragu is rich and flavorful...quality ingredients are used. While the agnolotti meat filling is perfectly flavored.

The prices were quite high, a two meat plate with tax was over 16 bucks $16.00+.

Personally, a bit of crusty bark on \\\\\"Q\\\\\" does a lot for the flavor.\\\\nLittle Miss is a step above, Rudy\\'s, Honey Bears, Dave\\'s and Can\\'t Stop Smokin BBQ but price wise any of those places are a better money value.\\\\nWould I return to Little Miss BBQ?

       "        'I took my son\\'s 10 year old C230 to Mercedes of Henderson several months ago to have the turn indicator switch replaced. The switch was obviously physically worn from many years of use and it simply wouldn\\'t stay in place until a turn was completed. I had purchased a new switch online from a Mercedes Dealer in Atlanta for $125 and I had intended to replace the switch myself. However, after researching what all was involved in the switch replacement procedure, I decided to have the dealer install it instead (big mistake!). When I called for an estimate, I was told the job would cost \\\\\"around $300\\\\\" (which actually turned out to be closer to $400). This seemed reasonable, so I brought the car in. While I was waiting, the mechanic that was working on my car came to the waiting area twice to speak with me. The first time he wanted to know why I thought the switch was bad. I told him it was beacause the switch wouldn\\'t stay in position during a turn ( I would I have thought this would be obvious to a professional mechanic). Then the next time the mechanic came, he asked me to go back to the garage with him. He showed me the steering column and said that there was an attached metal plate (located at the end of the column) that was loose and that is why the turn indicator wouldn\\'t stay in place. He said that the entire sterring column needed needed to be replaced (seriously? That\\'s got to cost thousands $$$ right?)). At that point, I picked up the new switch and showed him how it cleanly \\\\\"clicked\\\\\" into place when I moved the lever up and down. Then I picked up the old switch and showed him that the old switch action was extremely soft and did not click into place. I then said, \\\\\"and...this is why I know for a fact that the switch is indeed bad\\\\\". The mechanic responded by saying \\\\\"But its the steering column that made the switch fail and if you just replace the switch and not the steering column, the switch will fail again\\\\\" ( I remember wondering to myself if he was incompetent or if he was trying to rip me off, but I guess it didn\\'t matter since the result was the same). I asked him to just just replace the switch and to please put the car back together. For the next 6 weeks the switch worked perfectly (and as always, the steering column was nice and tight and had no play in it). Then after 6 weeks the windshield wipers and washer quit working. I quickly troubleshot the problem down to the same multifunction turn indicator switch. Had the mechanic been right all along??? I then pulled the steering wheel off and and removed the turn indicator switch. Upon examination of the switch I discovered that one of the wires (the black one) on the new switch had been worned clean through. I then dug out the old switch that had been returned to me in the new box by the Mercedes mechanic 6 weeks earlier.  I then discovered that within the box there was a note labeled \\\\\"WARNING\\\\\" in large bold font. The note clearly instructed the installer to trim the plastic lip off the steering column housing that surrounded the outside of the switch. This plastic lip that the mechanic had failed to remove, is the exact location of where the wire wore through (which is obviously why it needed to be trimmed down). Upon examination of the housing,it was quite evident that the mechanic had failed altogther to follow this procedure. At this point, I now have the car all apart in the garage and I really don\\'t have time to wait for another mail order switch. So I went back to Henderson Mercedes and wound up paying their parts dept. approx. $200 for another new switch. Unlike the trained Mercedes Mechanic, I was able to follow the basic instructions and trim the plastic off the steering column housing. I then installed the switch and recalibrated the power steering assist unit and the car has worked perfectly (and the steering column is perfectly tight) for the past 10 months. I am done with these guys, enough is enough! From now on I\\'ll either do it myself or take the car to EMC or my Lexus Service Center.',\n",

It\\'s a rare \\\\\"treasure\\\\\" that is fairly hidden right now.  Our groups consisted of about 10 people and we had a really nice guide who were able to tell us a lot of fun facts about the hotels that these signs used to belong to, as well as facts about the signs themselves, such as how much is involved in creating a neon sign and the science behind a lot of it.   All in all, it was incredibly interesting and you literally feel like you\\'re going back in time as you wander in between the signs while listening to tales about the mob and about how Las Vegas used to be.\\\\n\\\\nI highly recommend this for everyone, it\\'s sooo cool!  It won\\'t be the same once there\\'s an official museum there, but I\\'m happy they will be able to open one so that they can get funding to restore and keep these signs.\\\\n\\\\nSo... if you\\'re reading this in order to find out whether it\\'s worth it or not to pay $15 for the tour... yes!

They have strings of Christmas lights up in an artsy fashion. It ain't Christmas, but tis the season - it works with the overall feel of the restaurant.

We're very patient people but for us to wonder when our food will be at our table is a tell tale sign that they're taking way too long. Annoying, since we were essentially the only ones in the restaurant. But we gave them the benefit of the doubt and figured they were making our food ultra fresh.\\\\n\\\\nWhat we didn't realize when ordering was that their portions (at least for dinner) are huge! The two dishes were pretty good. Not the best we've ever had, but we had no major complaints. The chicken ginger and mushroom is quite misleading by name. The dish didn't have that extra bite of ginger I was searching for. Where were the mushrooms? They were hiding and didn't want to come out. There were a lot of other veggies though - carrots, onions, bell peppers. Good portion of chicken, which I appreciated. The beef pad see ew had a good amount of beef as well. They definitely don't shy away from your protein portions! Basil 'n Lime serves their pad see ew with regular broccoli. Perhaps this is consumer's preference but I definitely like my pad see ew with Chinese broccoli, not regular American broccoli. I feel as though Chinese broccoli gives the ample amount of crunch that a chewy dish such as pad see ew really needs. Both dishes were at a heat level of 5/10. I'll tell you what - heat level 5 barely scratched the capsaicin receptors on my tongue! If you like medium-spicy as I do, you should probably bump it up a notch to a 6, maybe a 7 if feeling a little brave. \\\\n\\\\nI'm not sure if I'll be back for dinner anytime soon.

The Summer roll has shrimp,pork and thin rice noodles wrapped in fresh rice paper wrappers and the same with the tofu rolls. It also came with a peanut dipping sauce. Pretty tasty and healthy appetizers.\\\\n\\\\nThere were different types of Pho on the menu and you can also make your own combination. All of them come with a side dish of toppings.  Asian basil, bean sprouts, lime and jalapenos.  The Pho I had was Pho w/brisket flank.  The beef broth was seasoned well and pretty tasty. .It didnt seem or wasnt oily like what some other reviews I have read.  The meat was tender, sliced thin.  Overall I enjoyed my meal here.',\n",

Insipid, tasteless, and overpriced - twenty seven bucks to boil some pasta and reheat a watery tomato sauce.

As 15 people were getting very hungry as it was 12:15 and no pizza, I called to find out about our pizzas.  The person told me that the pizzas were ready, but that the only delivery person had a flat tire and it would be at  least another 30 minutes (the troops are getting restless by this point) before they could deliver them, but that the pizza were ready.  So, I then decided to pick them up.  When I arrived! I was told that the pizzas were still in the oven and it would be another 10 minutes.  This was one of the worst customer service experiences I have ever had!  I would NOT recommend ordering.  The pizza itself was fine, but this completely ruined our office Christmas party.',\n",
       "        \"The most important thing to understand: this place is FUN.  But the food isn't great.\\\\n\\\\nWhat do I mean?  Well, each table is covered in white paper on which you can just go to town with the provided crayons.  Trivial pursuit cards and other bits of trivia on cardboard from other games are supplied in dishes usually reserved for sugar packets.  There's a fantastic beer selection, and you can walk right up to the rows of refrigerators and pick your own bottle.  It's just a fun place.\\\\n\\\\nNow, the food is where they run into some problems.  I went in a group of 4, and I can't recommend anything we had.  My salmon sandwich was so-so at best.  I tried someone else's deep fried Italian hoagie--which sounds AMAZING (in a totally sing-songy voice), but it somehow isn't.  It tasted like a sandwich of bland pepperoni and ham in a different bun, without anything else.  They have that tried and true Pittsburgh bar staple--the giant fish sandwich--but it didn't taste any better or worse than any other place.  And the fourth item (the only one I didn't try) was a burger ordered by the final member of our party--he says it was good, but he didn't even finish it.\\\\n\\\\nSo: good for drinking (though you can't really get there without designated drivers), great for having fun, bad for foodies or if you just want a meal.\",\n",

My husband and I decided to use the coupon this past Wednesday evening.\\\\n\\\\nA side note: Contrary to another recently posted review, Famous Daves DOES still have the weekly specials, as of mid-September of 2011. We were offered special pricing on the brisket meal due to it being 'Beef it Up Wednesday'. I was in the mood for ribs though, so I got a combo plate that included ribs and chopped pork. \\\\n\\\\nThe last time I had Famous Daves, I remember trying to pick up a rib with a fork and having the meat fall off the bone, it was so tender. This time the ribs were not tender at all, I had to work to get the meat off the bone.  The chopped pork was ok. I prfer pulled pork, but that's just a personal preference. My husband enjoyed the chicken sandwich he ordered, but thought the diablo bbq sauce was weak. I still love the corn bread muffins. \\\\n\\\\nI debated making this a 2 star review because well, I HAVE had better... But at the same time, it wasn't that bad. Our server was decent, friendly enough and pretty efficient. And with the coupon, the price was great. So 3 stars, but next time I am craving ribs I will be headed to either Tony Roma's or Lucille's.\",\n",

      "Text: This is honestly the best time I have had in Vegas by far! If you are looking for a fantastic pool party then look no further than the (in)famous Wet Republic at MGM!\\nMy tip for this place? Either prepay tickets, get on the guest list, win the lottery and buy bottle service or turn up early.\\n\\nMy partner, his friend and I first tried to get in on Friday 4th July to see Afrojack play and the line was absolutely ridiculous! We got told the club was at capacity and would have to wait 5 hours for even a chance of getting in. Wet Republic opens at 11am and we got there around 1/1.30pm so we decided to try again on Sunday 6th to see Tiesto.\\nThe next time was perfect! We arrived at 10.45am (we stayed at MGM so we were allowed to access the pool early), queued up and got in with minimal wait time and no issues. We found a little spot on the side of the pool and we stayed there all day, taking it in turns to mind our belongings. It got absolutely CRAZY and everyone was definitely having a good time although drinks are super expensive- on the plus side they are ridiculously strong, especially when you get the $38 yard glasses... they'll keep you going for a while.\\n\\nBe warned, if you are body conscious you may not enjoy this club until you get white girl wasted as the staff members are all absolutely gorgeous and the hostesses have the bodies of Greek Goddesses. The majority of the club goers are also stunning with \\\"perfect\\\" beach bodies and expensive looking swimsuits, there is a reason this place is a favourite amongst celebrities.\\n\\nDon't let it get you down though, it is honestly so much fun! The staff and all involved (in my experience) were super friendly, good fun and just wanted to dance around in a pool sipping drinks.\n",

      "Text: Toooasstttttt.....\\n\\nDrive up to the drive-thru like what up I want a chicken box. \\nWith some extra toast. Toooasstt!\\n\\nHere I was all excited, about the toast and all, and I pull up to the first window to pay and the cashier Sarah (I'm assuming it's Sarah cause, surprise, they put the name on the receipts) is snotty towards me. Ugh, what did I do to you chick, I just wanted some extra toast! She goes to hand me back my card without saying a word to me, but see's a coworker/friend on the other side of the parking lot and feels the need to shout REALLY LOUD to him, like \\\"bye\\\"or some shit. So in the mist of that she drops my card and just turns around to close the window. UH OK. Maybe if you didn't have those hideously obvious, fakeass colored-contact lenses in, you'd be able to see what the fuck you were doing and not drop my shit without so much an apology. You asshat.\\n\\nGot to the other window, got my delicious food with my fucking extra toast that I fucking really wanted and was like fuck yes, and drove off. \\n\\nFood wise, the chicken is good but if you're looking for a crispy country-fried version, this definitely ain't it, and the toast is obviously the best thing on the planet. The only thing I hate about this place is the french fries. They're those little wiggly, scrunchie shaped ones that remind me of the frozen shit they served in my elementary cafeteria. Blek. Toast is the best though for sure, and the only reason I even bother coming to this place.\\n\\nYou know I fucking love the toast if I'm dealing with little shithead teens to get it. YOOOOooooo\n",

The servers have a good sense of when to check in on you but give you enough space to enjoy the evening.  The food is spectacular - the Fez burger, sweet potato fries, blueberry and strawberry salad and the salmon are all fav's of mine.  My husband gets the lamb every time.

      "Text: I visited Sofrita on Saturday. The food is very good. The sangrias were outstanding. Too bad they were not able to solve the sewer gas smell in that location. The last restaurant in that spot also had the problem of a dried out drain. It's not that hard to figure out, get a plumber to fix it.  Fountain Hills needs a nice place to have tapas. The atmosphere is charming and once you get used to the smell you can eat but it is a real turn off when you first walk in the door. I hope they make it.\n",
