I call the store for FIFTEEN MINUTES, at least TEN TIMES-no answer! Finally they answer their phone and then proceed to tell me the driver was too scared to come back to my house, actual words \\\\\"he said it was dark and he felt uncomfortable\\\\\" then the manager added the store was about to close, so all in all, my pizza cannot be delivered. I understand the manager cannot make his child of a driver deliver my pizza if he claims to be \\\\\"uncomfortable\\\\\", so I still want my pizza, and decide to go down myself for my now AT LEAST 20 minute late pizza-mmm, yum.

I was also disappointed with the \\\\\"Lawn\\\\\" it is perhaps the smallest I have seen at any other park....and the \\\\\"Lawn\\\\\" is suppose to be the highlight really of any spring training park.\\\\n\\\\nAll in All this is good stadium and I definitely will return again in the future....but just another FYI....autographs are hard to come by here.....so don\\'t really expect to get many unless you catch the players when they are leaving the ballpark. Eat, Drink, and be Merry my Friends!!!!!',\n",
       "        \"The food is pretty delicious. It's pretty pricey too, but it's also cheaper than what you would pay for a very similar item using room service (27 for the All American breakfast thru room service vs 19 for the Vdara at the market - same items). I had the Tempura Lobster Bennies - wow, it tasted good, but holy smokes that was a RICH breakfast. I couldn't finish it because of how heavy the food was. My cholesterol probably shot up like 300 points as well. Service can be a little slow, so plan for that if you were planning on grabbing breakfast in a rush for check out or a flight.  And the reviews aren't joking, breakfast for 2 will cost you 50-60 bucks after tax. We had comps at the hotel so it wasn't bad, but if you don't you should get ready for that bill! I would go back if I had comps, but I am not necessarily sure if I would eat the ticket if I was paying out of pocket.\",\n",

It seems like a literal transition overnight from nice polite and attentive staff to now at every location I visit they are intrusive and will not let anyone shop in peace. \\\\n\\\\nI cannot go in now without feeling so pressured and for a lack of a better term-bothered. I am a very social person and I consider this as over the top behavior. \\\\n\\\\nI visited the Scottsdale Fashion Park location this weekend already knowing whats in store from the sales people based on experiences I\\'ve already had there. My girlfriend and I reluctantly went into the store to within moments have a sales girl follow us around with her obviously forced small talk. I picked up a shirt as my girl browsed a separate rack trying to get her away from us, but she didn\\'t take the hint. The sales girl then went on to try to convince me to purchase an item I already put back on the rack...seriously? She asked what I do for a living which is fine although bordering on personal. Among the onslaught of irritating interaction and unnecessary, obviously forced questioning she was pestering us about where we live and what we were doing . This continued as we were pulling the dressing room door shut. Seriously, take a hint and let us at least try things on in peace. I left some clothes at the register and we ran out of there with out the purchases we wanted to make, we couldn\\'t deal with the awkward and annoying behavior any longer. \\\\n\\\\n(I\\'m serious, while I\\'m pulling the door shut she is like \\\\\"so where you guys from!?\\\\\")\\\\n\\\\nNow all of these questions might seems harmless and I get that some sales folks are generally trying to build a rapport, I have worked in retail and restaurant service in the past...I get it. Whatever Lucky Brand has come up with in these new changes is almost as though they are reading from a script with the line of questioning as it is identical at several locations. Your staff needs to be able to identify when people aren\\'t interested in playing along. I am here to buy clothes, not for a speed dating event with your staff. People skills are not something you can really teach but social cues should be obvious when guests are bordering on anger trying to get away from being pestered by staff in a small shop. \\\\n\\\\nI hope this review finds its way to a senior staff member because I love the merchandise but we hate the idea of returning because of a recurring problem.',\n",

       "        \"Family trip to Vegas, quite a few Ramsey fans amongst us.  Total of 8 diners off of the grill menu.  We made a reservation and our table was ready for us.\\\\n\\\\nService - Solid.  Our waiter was friendly and knowledgable.  The staff was attentive to our needs with regard to keeping water full and table clear.  My only complaint would be the drink menu.  I can dig conserving paper and flashy electronics, but passing a couple iPads around to place drink orders was a bit of a hassle.\\\\n\\\\nAmbiance - I liked it.  I wouldn't call it a traditional pub, but the feel is there.  The noise level is moderate, with an eclectic mix of British rock/pop on the playlist.  The uniforms fit with the theme.  I work with beer for a living and I am without a doubt overly anal retentive with regards to it.  So, a wall made of kegs in a British themed pub didn't sit right with me.  Casks would have been much more appropriate.  Speaking of casks . . .\\\\n\\\\nBeverages - Admittedly, we were all looking at beer, it's a pub after all.  For everyday beer selection, I'd give it a big thumbs up.  Lots of imported and expected domestic draft options, and a more craft friendly bottle selection.  I got a Union Jack, brother got a Sculpin, mom got a SNPA.  Their's was fresh, mine wasn't.  Que Sera, at least the options were there.  I would say this is more disappointing after visiting BURGR this afternoon and being offered a much more impressive beer list.  Lastly, it is a Pub, how is there nothing on cask?  If you are an avid beer advocate temper your expectations.\\\\n\\\\nFood - Not one of the 8 off us left disappointed or hungry.  Between the 8 of us we tried the Pork and Lamb Rillettes appetizer, Lamb T-bone, Shepard's Pie, Brick Pressed Cornish Hen, Clams and Mussels, Pork Belly and sides of Brusselspouts and Fingerling Potatoes.\\\\n\\\\nBread and starters: The bread, holy geez the bread.  A selection of pretzel breads and a beer roll served with Devonshire butter and a Welsh cheddar spread with horseradish.  I can't believe they don't charge for this, it is easily one of the best things that was put on our table.  The Rillettes were excellent as well.  I favored the pork over the duck, which admittedly was a bit bland for duck.  It comes with a fabulous horseradish infused mustard, crispy acidic house made pickles of carrot and radish.\\\\n\\\\nMains - I am going to jump right to it.  Everything was at least good, but the Shepard's Pie is absolutely astounding and I would say the best thing we had on the table.  The pork belly, which I ordered was very good, crispy and fatty just as it should be.  It has a pea pur\\\\u00e9e with it that is hardly noticeable and tiny chippolini(sp?) onions for sweetness.  All together great dish I wouldn't hesitate to order again.  I did not try a clam, but the mussels were great.  They were massive and came swimming in a delicious broth and a few heels of bread to drag through it.  The hen we a little dry but, my goodness, was the skin crispy.  The lamb was well prepared, perfectly cooked.  It is topped with Stilton, which I find to be a relatively medium flavored blue cheese, but in this situation it surprisingly dominated the lamb.  It was good to be sure, but could be better.\\\\n\\\\nSides:  The brusselsprouts were outstanding, simply prepared with bacon and apples.  Cooked perfectly, flavorful and a great compliment to the fatty pork.  The potatoes were potatoes.  They are tough to screw up and were not here.\\\\n\\\\nOverall - For the 8 of us it came to just under $50/person, but I'd say that is a comfortable number for the experience we had. I wouldn't hesitate to come back.\",\n",

We just stayed here 10/11/14. \\\\n\\\\nReserved a room here for the Navy Ball. Looked online and seemed like a plush stay and the convenience of being able to walk from ballroom-hotel room was a bonus. Drove all the way from San Diego and arrived at a bit after 12pm and had to fight to get checked in (supposed 3pm check in?! Who checks in just 2 hours before a FORMAL event?!) Finally get a room and it\\'s directly in front of the spa so lots of foot traffic. Open door and it\\'s filthy and decorated circa 1989. We didn\\'t bother to unpack. It was so sparsely furnished and dirty that we called the hotel manager asking for a refund and cancellation so we can go to the Hilton just down the road. He refused. The room had leaves and stains on the carpet, one chair at a metal quick order restaurant style table, calcified faucets in the bathroom, a tub that didn\\'t drain, frayed and dirty towels. He refused to refund us stating they had a 48hr cancellation policy (yep, because we magically knew it would be filthy from 500 miles away!)  He instead \\\\\"upgraded\\\\\" us to one of their 2story suites. The driver takes us over and what do you know, it needs all new towels AND the sofa had a white stain on the seat...ew! Housekeeping had to come clean it and we had such little time we didn\\'t bother trying to fight them again. Of course at the end of the night we are tired and frustrated with the days events only to find bugs! Of goodness. The next morning at check out the hotel manager was shown photos and everything explained and he just shrugged. I would NEVER EVER EVER recommend this hotel to anyone and believe me, the US Navy Ball probably will NOT use this resort again for next year. \\\\n\\\\n*Also had a HORRID experience at their spa. I booked a hair appt a week prior to arriving explaining I wanted soft waves and that I had professional human hair extensions. The lady who booked me said the hair dressers were all experienced with extensions and it wouldn\\'t be a problem. After so many problems with the hotel, I should have known the spa wasn\\'t much better! I had shampooed my own hair prior to my 3pm appt and was given to one if their most \\\\\"experienced\\\\\" hair dressers. He asks what I want and I show him multiple photos of simple retro soft waves. He attempts to do my hair twice and it ends up looking like huge Texas poof. I literally broke into tears! I asked him to fix it twice. He finally told me, it was because my hair was layered so it wasn\\'t possible to achieve \\\\\"that look\\\\\". It\\'s an hour before my event! I quickly google an easy and simple chignon (Kate Middleton look) and ask him to stop jackin\\' my hair to Jesus and just give me an elegant and not so big hair style. It takes him 2 more tries, 100 bobby pins, and a bottle of hair spray before it looks somewhat like the photo. He knew I was unhappy but said it was my hair\\'s fault. I didn\\'t have time to even attempt to go to another salon to have it fixed at this point. I go to the counter where you apparently pay and the lady tells me $65. My friend just had an up do done an hour prior and it was $55. I just hand my card so I can get out of there before I cry. She sees I\\'m unhappy and asks, and I honestly replied that No I was NOT happy. She just shrugged and gave me my receipt.* \\\\n\\\\nAll in all, this hotel is dirty, has poor customer service, and offers substandard services. I would NEVER EVER EVER book another stay here even if it was free. (Which it wasn\\'t, even after everything that happened!)',\n",

That cute waterfall by the stairs, the overcrowded dance floor with more guys than girls, the \\\\\"secret\\\\\" nook where the skeezy guys would drag their drunken dance partners ... and the bathroom! The bamboo faucet was easily my favorite part of the Tiki Lounge. I looked forward to washing my hands. I dragged my friends inside the bathroom to see it. I wanted (and still kinda want) one for my future home.\\\\n\\\\nI have a lot of memories from this place. Some good, some bad. But surely that is the charm of the Tiki Lounge. The fuzzy cloud of time and nostalgia has probably added a star to my review. But I\\'m okay with that if you are. I hope the Tiki Lounge never changes.',\n",

Boom Kaizen popped up near UNLV. \\\\n\\\\nThe food, for the price is awesome, I got a baked salmon roll. Delicious. Unlike all the other all you can eat places here and original. He got some type of calamari roll and something else. \\\\n\\\\nAdding an $11 lychee flavored sake and a green tea tempura ice cream (but they don't serve vanilla flavor which didn't really make any sense to me but who am I...) who couldn't be more pleased?\\\\n\\\\nWell... let's start from the beginning. \\\\n\\\\nThe serve here was beyond poor. Upon entrance the two girls that we were working had just the most unengaging attitudes and missed so many marks.

Anyway - it was an odd experience. Given I understand it's 5:30 in the morning at that point everyone wants to go home and they're shoving people out, but the place is still an establishment and the restaurant clearly strategically placed itself across certain hotel&casinos for a reason, but the place was dead on a Saturday night for obvious reasons...\\\\n\\\\nI mean it's obviously not the food, the food is great and decently priced.\\\\n\\\\nWorth it if it's LAST LAST minute late night dinner and you're near the UNLV campus.\",\n",

The Med seasoning is a dry season and was pretty good as it had a teeny tiny kick but you can still taste the food.\\\\n\\\\n2) Gumbo with rice $6: Dont get this item.  Totally not worth it!! The gumbo was pretty bland that I had to put in a ton of Tabasco to make it taste like anything.  They barely give you any rice (please see the Service note below). \\\\n\\\\n3) 2 lb. Crawfish (She-Bang seasoning and Med heat) $10/pound:  When the bag was first placed on the table, all you see are super large crawfish soaking in a bath of liquid yumminess.  Then you grab one and is let down that there isn\\'t even a small kick to the Med heat.  And the more you dig in, the more you notice the crawfish are smaller and smaller.  Yes i understand that it is still by weight so its not like you\\'re getting cheated... but I want big ones and that\\'s that!!\\\\n\\\\nFOOD (2nd round of orders): \\\\n1) Chicken Tender with Fries (XXX heat) $7:  The chicken tenders aren\\'t anything special and the pieces are not large (but at least they weren\\'t small lol).  Same fries except the XXX seasoning was all heat and no taste.  \\\\n\\\\n2) 2 lb. Crawfish (She-Bang seasoning and XXX heat) $10/pound: So i should have explain their heat level earlier - the XXX is suppose to be the hottest one as its stated on the menu \\\\\"Cant feel my mouth\\\\\" and the level right above that is the Med... They need to figure out something to go in between the Med and XXX.  The XXX was indeed spicier then the Med but if you\\'re a restaurant you should know that a hot level should still mean you maintain the taste of your food! \\\\n\\\\nThere was so much cayenne/chili pepper in the dry XXX heat that you couldn\\'t taste any of the food.  All you get is a coating of dry power that overwhelm your taste buds.  \\\\n\\\\nI would like to make a point that is probably not that important but for me I feel like its something worth noting... They only give you one corn when you purchase at least 2lb. bag of crawfish. Which is fine... but where is the potato!?!? Yes I know this isnt Hot n\\' Juicy... but where is it!?!?!\\\\n\\\\nSERVICE:\\\\nWhere should I start... So our server didnt introduce himself so i\\'m only assuming his name is Spencer since it was on our check which may not be correct since half way through another waiter assisted us. \\\\n\\\\nHe wasnt really friendly as we had to ask about pricing for everything.  I\\'m sorry, if I\\'m inquiring about pricing, wouldn\\'t you assume i would like to be inform and you should be nice to let me know instead of me having to pull teeth????\\\\n\\\\nOur waiter talked my fiance out of ordering the XXX the first time around, which is \\\\nfine and we took it as friendly advice.  However, when we got our Med heat orders we wanted something spicier, we asked if we can get a small side of the dry XXX seasoning so we can get more kick.  We were told he cant do that but if we wanted to order something else such a side order of corn, I can get the corn in a big soaked with liquid XXX sauce... great so if I want to season my food to my liking, you\\'re going to make me buy more... right... This annoys me the most since he was the one convincing us not to order the XXX in the first place.  \\\\n\\\\nAnyway moving on... I ordered the Gumbo with Rice and I didnt get gumbo with rice.  The whole reason for going to Boiling Crab was cause I was craving rice with lots of sauce!  And what could satisfy my craving for saucey rice?? Gumbo! but nope, didnt even hit the stop.  I had to stop another waiter and tell her that I didnt get my correct order.  Instead of just bringing me a cup of rice, she takes my whole cup back to the kitchen and comes back with it...when i get my cup back, it looked like someone took 1 spoonful of rice and dumped it in.  I didnt realize rice was such an expensive item that I cant even get more than 1 spoonful.  \\\\n\\\\nSo after all this interaction, our waiter comes by and ask us how we were doing.  My fiance being the nice guy that he is says everything is great where I said things werent so good.  I\\'m pretty sure our waiter thought I was being sarcastic since my comment came after my fiance and it assume it was though \\\\\"oh its awful but i\\'m still stuffing my face that\\'s its obviously amazing food\\\\\"... nope, I didnt say it like that or mean it like that.  He just walks off like nothing happened.  \\\\n\\\\nSo i\\'m writing this review a few hours after my visit to Boiling Crab... and in our group only three of us had their \\\\\"fresh\\\\\" crawfish... and now all three of us arent feel so well.  \\\\n\\\\nThat sums up my extremely delight experience and will never stop back in that place and any of their other locations.

       "        \"I went here for dinner on Saturday night and was incredibly disappointed.  I come to Vegas a few times a year and have eaten at many of the higher end restaurants with this being a place I wish never to return to.  I figured it would be a safe bet since we were attending Le Reve after dinner.  My sister and I sat on the Teppan side and I have had better and less expensive meals at smaller chains and even Benihana.  The view of the waterfalls were pretty, especially at night.  The service was ok, our server was friendly..  but the meal...  Ugh!  My sister chose the tofu and gardein meal while I chose the chicken.  The meal was so incredibly salty, it was almost inedible.  I think we each drank 3 glasses of water and didn't even finish or get close to finishing our meal.  The chicken was so overlooked, it was almost dry and difficult to eat unless you dipped in a sauce or drank a gulp of water after. I heard the tofu and gardein were cooked well, but again VERY salty.  I have had a variety of good and bad meals at Teppan restaurants and for $65, I expect that you are not going to mess up a chicken breast.  I can do that at home for about $7.  The vegetables were cooked well, but again, a bit on the salty side.  The only bright side to this meal was the dessert.  The little gelato with crumble was delicious.  The little lemon cheesecake was ok..  Nothing special. It took forever for someone to clear our plate and I am assuming this was because our plates were nearly full.  I remember the chef's name but I am not going to be mean and call him out because he was a nice guy who was a bit on the entertaining side.  I really wish I had decided to go to Carnevino instead... This place gave me the worst birthday meal... Ever.  For the price and location, I expected perfection or something close to it.  Incredible disappointment.\",\n",

I placed my order on-line - the box meal they advertise, some wings and dipping sauces (a little annoyed that not even one dipping sauce comes with the wings) and received the specified time that my order would be ready. I arrived about 5 minutes after my order was scheduled to be ready. When I got there, my pizza was ready, but for some reason they neglected to include the wings and sauces I paid for. so I had to wait about 10 minutes for them to make my wings. Once they were finished I was sent on my way with no apology or anything.\\\\n\\\\nOn Sunday my son wanted their wings again, so I gave them another shot. Once again I placed my order on-line and got there about 5 minutes after my order was scheduled to be ready. After I paid, I was told that my order wasn't quite ready. After about 10-15 minutes a girl came out and gave me my wings. Again, no apology for the wait or anything. I asked her if I could speak to a manager because by this time I was beyond frustrated. She told me I'd have to wait because she was busy. I explained that I had been waiting for almost 15 minutes for my food. I didn't feel like I should have to continue waiting, especially since all it would take was for her turn around, look through the window and ask the manager to come up. Rather than get the manager, she argued with me about why I needed to wait. After I kind of yelled through the window myself, a manager came out. When I explained what had happened on this visit and the visit two days prior, she shrugged her shoulders, said she was sorry and that they were busy. I looked at her in disbelief because there was only one family in the establishment and there were three other people working in the kitchen. I complained a little more, but could see that she really didn't care. I told her I would not be a returning customer and again her response was a shoulder shrug. I will say that another customer did come in and placed an order while I was waiting for my food, but if they can't handle multiple orders at one time then they really should reconsider being open for business at all.\\\\n\\\\nOne other thing of note is that on the second visit the place looked and smelled dirty. The floors weren't clean and there was just a foul odor that overpowered the smell of the food.\\\\n\\\\nThey get 1 star because yelp won't let me submit with 0.\",\n",

This, my friends, is unfortunately the latter.\\\\n\\\\nThe short version of my post: Foundation Room tried to play us for fools and ruined our dining experience.\\\\n\\\\nThe long version: (which I hope you\\'ll read because it\\'s quite ridiculous)\\\\n\\\\nTo start things off, my girlfriends and I ordered a bottle of Pinot Noir. Nothing fancy, just a $50 bottle that we were already planning to order more of (get Vegas started off right, right?!) So we order the first bottle and this is where the fun begins...\\\\n\\\\nInstead of bringing out the bottle and doing the normal wine presentation that you\\'re used to seeing at a restaurant, she brings out a tray with four pre-filled glasses that each look as though they have one shot of wine in each glass. She sets them down in front of us and leaves. My friends and I (who are no strangers to wine) just stare at each other in disbelief. She calls this a glass of wine? Where is the rest? There was maybe three sips in each. Maybe. Now, I know we didn\\'t order their top notch bottle and I didn\\'t expect their in-house sommelier to pour it, but I did expect to at least see the bottle and I did expect to at least receive the entire contents of the bottle that we were paying for and not just a portion of it. Everyone at the table knew instantly that there was no way we were poured an entire bottle of wine (unless, of course, it was the World\\'s smallest bottle of wine.)\\\\n\\\\nNow, since we had no proof that she didn\\'t pour us the entire bottle (since she never brought it out to us and it was pre-poured in back) we ordered another bottle for our husbands and asked for new glasses. We also asked her for the bottle to be brought to the table(uncorked) and a presentation. Our waitress obliged. She came out with the new bottle, corked it before us and filled up the new glasses in the exact amount she did with the first four original wine glasses. And guess what, surprise surprise, after pouring the contents in equal amounts as the first round, there was still HALF A BOTTLE left remaining on the table. So our little experiment worked and proved that she did in fact completely scam us on the first bottle ordered--by filling our glasses in the back of the house and trying to pass it off as a full bottle.\\\\n\\\\nWe were obviously bummed this was happening, especially given the reputation of the restaurant, so in order to remedy the situation and not cause a scene, one of my girlfriends pulled the waitress aside in the hallway and told her we knew what had happened and that we just wanted things made right. The waitress completely agreed, apologized for the situation and told my friend she\\'d make sure it was taken care of. \\\\n\\\\nFoundation Rooms remedy: Two complimentary desserts (which we didn\\'t order) and instead of charging us for a full bottle for the first bottle, they charged us for four individual glasses of wine instead.\\\\n \\\\nNow, why do people order bottles of wine instead of individual glasses of wine at restaurants? Because it\\'s cheaper and you get more, right? So aside from the desserts we didn\\'t want, their solution was to actually charge us MORE for the wine than what we had originally asked for. My blood pressure was through the roof at this point. The dessert was a nice gesture, but we didn\\'t ask for it. I was completely fine paying full amount for the second bottle since we actually were able to enjoy it fully BUT BY GOD I wasn\\'t paying anything towards something we didn\\'t order, weren\\'t able to enjoy and were just outright cheated on.\\\\n\\\\nI gestured the waitress over, pointed to the four glasses of wine by the glass listed on the receipt and simply told her \\\\\"Mam, we did not order four glasses of wine, we ordered a bottle of wine. Since you and I both know we did not receive a bottle of wine, I would like these glasses of wine we didn\\'t order removed.\\\\\" \\\\n\\\\nOur waitress nodded, and without hesitation, FINALLY fixed the situation.\\\\n\\\\nWe travel to Vegas three-four times a year and needless to say, I do not recommend The Foundation Room and will not be returning. \\\\n\\\\nI hope you find this review helpful and that Foundation Room improves their manner and poor service.',\n",

Lenny moved from Detroit and has been in Arizona since 1984 serving his amazing burgers.   My visit here was fantastic.  I ordered a Ranch Bacon Cheeseburger with fries. The service was great, the food was delicious (just the way I remembered it) and Lenny was there with a smile.  He even came by our table to see how everything was.  \\\\n\\\\nI recommend this place to anyone looking for great service and amazing burgers!! \\\\n\\\\nJob well done Lenny!\",\n",
       "        'It pains me to give the services department a poor review.   \\\\n\\\\nWhen I realized that this was the bike shop that Francisco had gone to after having worked on my bike at Bike Source (back when the service was actually good at Bike Source) I was hopeful that I had found a place to get my bike serviced.  \\\\n\\\\nThis store is obviously focused on road not mountain biking.  Being primarily a mountain biker, I was hesitant to use this store for my repair work.  I specifically asked if they serviced mountain bikes and was told that this a \\\\\"Full Service Bike Shop\\\\\".  Great.  I dropped off my bike and promptly got a call from Francisco.  He was extremely detailed and listed every little bit of wear and tear on my bike.  He told me what needed to be replaced and what I could keep using for the time being but would have to replace down the road.  He didn\\'t miss anything, but he didn\\'t try to sell me on unneeded parts and service either.  Great service thus far!\\\\n\\\\nOne thing I needed was a new tire.  I went to pick up my bike but was told that they didn\\'t carry tires in my wheel size.  Okay, no big deal.  My bike is several years old and the 26 inch wheels are disappearing fast. I bought a tire elsewhere and brought it in.  Another mechanic who was working asked me if I knew how to install a tubeless tire.  Yes, I do. But is it a bit concerning that the \\\\\"bike mechanic\\\\\" is asking me how to install a tire?!?  He placed a call to another mechanic and was told that he needed Stan\\'s to seal the tire but they they only had full bottles and not the install kit.  He didn\\'t know what Stan\\'s was or what an install kit was.  Wow. A full service bike shop?  I think not.  \\\\n\\\\nSo once again, I left without my bike.  A few days later I showed up, with my Stan\\'s Sealant, so that the tire could be installed.  Finally, my bike was ready to ride, or so I thought.  I had initially brought my bike in because the fork wasn\\'t holding pressure.  As I was rolling bike away I put some pressure on the handlebars and the fork when all the way down as there was no pressure in the suspension.  Back to the services department I went.  I was told that they weren\\'t able to get the proper seal and that I had to take the bike to a Specialized dealer.  So I paid for a fork rebuild for a fork that was not functional. This was roughly $100 if I recall correctly.    \\\\n\\\\nI took my bike to Bike Source to have the seal installed.  I was charged for a fork rebuild all over again.\\\\n\\\\nTo sum it up: My time was wasted. My money was wasted.  Do NOT bring your mountain bike here.  They don\\'t have the parts to service a mountain bike and some of the staff could not have less knowledge about mountain bikes.  I had to come back to the shop Three times before actually leaving with my bike.  And even then it wasn\\'t fixed and I had to take it to another shop.  The money that I spent here on a fork rebuild was completely wasted as the job wasn\\'t completed and I had to take my bike to another shop.  I may give this shop a try with my road bike.  But my fat tire is never going to be serviced here again.',\n",

Came for dinner in a hopeful and enthusiastic mood since the reviews have been pretty good, but I don\\'t think this place lives up to its current good, but declining rating.\\\\n\\\\nOrdered the Combo fried rice (shrimp, chicken, beef, pork), sesame chicken, and garlic fried chicken. \\\\n\\\\nThe combo fried rice was pretty good, but ended up drinking about 6 glasses of water due to the MSG and sodium content. You\\'d think that the cook spent his better years in the French Foreign Legion in the Sahara eating salt tablets and developed a taste for them. \\\\n\\\\nThe sesame chicken had a good flavor and a thick brown sweet sauce. I liked it a lot until it got cool and the sauce looked (with that stringy consistency) more like glue. You think I\\'m kidding? I\\'m not.\\\\n\\\\nGarlic fried chicken was bad. Just bad. It was like an over roasted dried out half chicken with some dried garlic pieces sprinkled on top. No spices, no flavor, no good. \\\\n\\\\nWe then got all kinds of lip from the waitress when we asked if they could change the channel on the TV from college football, to the Suns game. They made it into this big deal that the \\\\\"customers\\\\\" wanted to see the football game. Yeah right, it was University of West Virginia Vs. University of Connecticut!

My wife and I went here because the Bacchanal buffet was way too crowded so I explained to her the Monte Carlo (MC) buffet was decent or at least that's how I remembered it. Here are the list of problems I see with this place and I bring it up because my family has been in the restaurant industry in Los angeles where ppl are far more critical and the cleanliness factor is held to a higher standard. MC's buffet was not only dirty but there were a number of tables covered with nasty old dishes for the entire time of our dining experience. The servers only visited once and even then did nothing about the unsightly mess around us. The food selection was very limited and on multiple instances the staff were using their bare hands to scoop food sitting on counters back into trays. A major food safety concern. Shrimp were sitting in pools of cloudy melted ice water and all food stations were messy enough that plates could not be rested on countertops. It was clear that the staff were short handed and lacked pride in what they were doing. This will be the last time I ever eat here. Sadly this was one of Vegas' best kept secrets but is now probably one of the worst I have seen. This comes as no surprise as I read other reviews for this place.

       "        'This is a long review but worth the read, this is a span of close to 2.5-3 hours this took place.\\\\n\\\\nIf I could give this place zero stars I would. First got there at 1:45pm to have 2 new tires mounted on the front. I asked him if needed to use the rebuild kits for the tpms sensors and he said \\\\\"No you don\\'t have too\\\\\" which was also told to me over the phone a week prior when I called around. Since they said we can mount and un-mount around the sensor without breaking it. \\\\n\\\\nSo after that we went back inside so he can take my info and I asked about alignments, and the original cost was 69.99 but told me if i was to do it today he will do it for 49.99 and said ok sounds good. Then I asked him how long will this take and his exact words were \\\\\"As you can see both bays are open, as in the tire and alignment so it won\\'t take long about 30-45 mins\\\\\" I agreed and had a friend pick me up to take me back home.\\\\n\\\\nIt was now 2:55pm and had no call so I called them back for an update and they told me we haven\\'t mounted the tires yet cause we are waiting for the TPMS rebuild kits. Which I was confused because the other guy said I didn\\'t need it. Then the \\\\\"Manager\\\\\" told me about the laws and how they can\\'t do that and such, and I said \\\\\"Ok but the other guy didn\\'t say I needed it and it was fine\\\\\" Manager \\\\\"Well it doesn\\'t matter what he says cause we have to do it this way\\\\\" Me \\\\\"well yes it does cause I shouldn\\'t have to pay for it if this was never told to me\\\\\" Then the manager told me the new total and it was about 7-8 bucks higher then what it was so I was like ok. Then I asked the manager, so was the alignment atleast done and he said \\\\\"Yes that is done, just waiting for the rebuild kits from our vendor they usually take 20-30 minutes to drop things off but today they are taking alittle longer\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\nSo I decided to give them 40 more minutes and had a friend pick me up and drop me off at 3:40pm, I saw they finally got to one tire. The front desk guy that I first spoke to told me they lost one of the TPMS sensors so had to get another, I\\'m like wtf ok. But don\\'t worry I\\'ll find it. 5 mins goes by and he said I found the kit and they will start the 2nd wheel. \\\\n\\\\nBut after 10 mins passes no one was working on the 2nd wheel, I can see the wheel sitting there on the mount machine, but what happened was he lied to me saying he found it but really they were waiting for their vendor to drop off another set, cause I saw him with my own eyes. I\\'m like dude, you guys didn\\'t even find it your vendor had to drop another set off. \\\\n\\\\nWhy would you lie about something so small to buy yourself time. \\\\n\\\\nI then asked \\\\\"How did the alignment go\\\\\" he said \\\\\"We haven\\'t done it yet\\\\\" WTFFFFF your manager told me you guys did it already. But that was another lie and then he says \\\\\"Oh don\\'t worry we will get you out of here in 15 mins\\\\\" Me \\\\\"You guys can mount a tire and do a alignment in 15mins!!?!?\\\\\" \\\\n\\\\nThey obviously think anyone that comes in there is not mechanically inclined, you can\\'t mount a tire and do a alignment correctly in 15 mins. But at this point I just wanted to get my car out of there and cancelled the alignment. Cause they clearly don\\'t know how to estimate time properly, which I noticed since 2 other guys waiting were complaining as well. \\\\n\\\\nNow the so called \\\\\"Manager\\\\\" brought me out to my car and said the tire your brought in isn\\'t truly round and you can see the wobble so when you leave you will have some bad shakes, at this point, really the new tire I brought in. First I was driving it before and there wasn\\'t any wobbles and when you look at the tire rotate on the balancing machine it was the rim that was moving so it looked like the wheel was properly secured on the balancing machine. \\\\n\\\\nManager then went off saying \\\\\"I\\'ve owned a lot of high end cars so I know what I am doing\\\\\" why does that have anything to do on this situation, I don\\'t care if you owned high end cars or a damn moped, that has nothing to do with this situation. So stop trying to brag or lie and finish my car. That was suppose to be done 2 hours ago.\\\\n\\\\nI then just go inside and wait another 5-10 mins for my damn car. Front desk guy says your car is ready. But before he gives me the bill, the so called manager comes inside and starts typing all these notes on my account. Too basically protect their own ass if anything would have happened.\\\\n\\\\nBut then I get the bill and I saw that they billed me for 2 tpms kits, so I said \\\\\"So you guys are going to charge me for the kits\\\\\" Manager \\\\\"yea we are cause you needed them and we have to legally do it\\\\\" Me \\\\\"Even though this guy right here said I didn\\'t need it\\\\\" Manager \\\\\"Doesn\\'t matter what he said\\\\\" Me \\\\\"actually it does cause you can\\'t have 2 people saying 2 different things\\\\\" Then the front desk guy chimes in \\\\\"Well I mentioned it\\\\\" Me \\\\\"You didn\\'t say I HAD TOO, and you said we can do without them, all your doing is trying to save your own ass as well\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\n**Review** Continued on follow up',\n",

It was fairly dark and relaxing. The temperature was not warm enough for me but my boyfriend did not have the same problem. The bed itself was comfortable except when I was laying face down my chin was hitting metal, so perhaps the bed (or myself) was not positioned correctly. The other problem is that when you flip to your back the recessed lighting is shining right in your eyes so perhaps they should put eye masks on for that part. I would have spoken up about these things but since it was a couples massage I didn't want to interrupt my other half's experience. \\\\n\\\\nMatthew was my masseuse. He was very professional and overall gave a nice massage.  I especially enjoyed the hand portion. His firmness was perfect not too hard-not too soft. My feet were icecubes though so I was surprised he did not mention that or ask if I was warm enough....maybe he thought I had circulation issues who knows. I would recommend him for sure though. \\\\n\\\\nMy boyfriend had Shasta as his masseuse. He said it was the best he ever had and even began to nod off during portions of it.

       "        'We went here for Mother\\'s Day based on the positive reviews and had a pleasant experience.  Good food, good service, good ambiance.  We came back here for Father\\'s Day and had a very unpleasant experience; the worst display of management I have ever encountered!  Apparently our order was never put in from the server or there was some sort of \\\\\"computer malfunction\\' they claimed, but we waited at the table for 45 minutes after ordering, no food, nothing.  The server obviously recognized the mistake and kept checking in with us and apologized for the unusually long wait, (did I mention the restaurant was half empty, I wonder why!) and she did offer to comp our coffee drinks.  But the infuriating part was when we finally complained to the manager because we could not figure out why the ridiculously long wait, she came over to our table, did not properly introduce herself, sat down and pointed to the man-held computer system and TOLD US we had only been waiting 15 minutes.  Really?!?  You\\'re coming over to tell us how long we have been waiting???  It was so rude and disrespectful, she was trying to argue her point to us which clearly showed that the server did not put in our order immediately which is probably why the server apologized to us umpteen times!!!  It was the most ridiculous display of what NOT to do as a manager.  I have been in management and customer service for over 12 years and this was clearly a Management 101 mistake.  She never apologized or tried to rectify the situation, but when you come out to your customers in fighting mode you really cannot rectify that! \\\\n\\\\n Needless to say, unless this restaurant starts to provide better training to their managers and team members, or hires a new manager, we will NOT be coming back here again.',\n",

It was a croissant bread, shredded turkey, a stuffing patty and cranberry jam. My friends got the smoked salmon platter & the turkey burger, both of them said it was alright too. Now the ambiance was obviously a typical Vegas/casino kind of feel, drunk people walking all over the place and loudness - which didn\\'t really bother me. There was  a good amount of tables and booths, all reserved for people of the restaurant (those \\'reserved\\' tents really did throw me off ~ reserved for who!?).

This place is a treasure chest of everything from collectible comic books, to rare LP's and hard to find books. I go here at least once a week to checkout their clearance section and have always found a rare gem to add to my collection.  \\\\n\\\\nFor those who need the over thought conformity of say a Borders or don 't mind tapping into their 401k to pay for that new James Patterson novel at Barnes and Nobel, this place is not for you. There is no trendy little cafe (who needs hot coffee anyways? It is over 100 degrees outside). This is the type of place that reminds you of going to a yard sale and you notice a rare 1st edition of say Harry Potter. The only real downside has to be the music that they play over the speaker system and the low payout they offer for used books and DVD 's.\\\\n\\\\n I brought in over 100 DVD 's and they only offered me 37 dollars (yeah right) so I have to say unless you are just trying to get rid of that wal-mart bargain bin movie you got for x-mas do not bother trading in anything.

It's nearly impossible to go anywhere without having to pay to park.\\\\n-After just finding out I have to pay $18 to park, I did NOT want to tip a bellhop, so I asked for a luggage cart so we could take up our own bags. He said he couldn't give us a cart unless we also allowed him to help. So there was another expense before I even got to my room!\\\\n-Everyone seems very confused... the front desk and the piece of paper with hotel details had conflicting information about the pool hours, etc.\\\\n-The walls are paper thin. I heard the man in the next room cough, flush the toilet, turn on the hair dryer, etc. We were also across from the ice machine, which I heard every time.\\\\n-After listening to the man next door get ready and leave at 8am, the REALLY loud noises started. We were on the 10th floor, and I'm not sure if they were using a jackhammer on the 11th floor, but that's sure what it sounded like. It wasn't just in our room, you could hear the noises in the hallway and in the elevator. If construction is going on, they should probably warn their guests, or put non-vacationing guests below the construction. If I were there on business, I wouldn't have even known about the noises since they started around 8:30am. Instead I was looking forward to sleeping in on my vacation, but didn't get to. Not to mention I got to listen to the loud, obnoxious noise the whole time I showered and got ready.\\\\n-BRING YOUR OWN FOOD AND DRINKS. I was thirsty and my boyfriend was hungry. He took $5 down to the vending machine and came back with a snack bag of chips and one soda. I didn't know we would be paying stadium prices for food and drinks from vending machines.\\\\n-I booked 3 months prior to our trip through priceline and called immediately to request a King size bed. I'm pretty sure they didn't even make a note of it or attempt to accommodate us.\\\\n-I am positive that I left my Swarovski ring on the nighstand, but they told me that housekeeping didn't see it (check her hand, she's probably wearing it)\\\\n\\\\nOverall our stay here wasn't great, but you can't beat the location.

       "        'I remember when going to the Spaghetti Company was something to look forward to. Back then (about 30 years ago) it was one of the few restaurants in town, so the wait was considerable. That lobby is still there with the same stand-up video games and circa 20s sofas (reupholstered of course) and the restaurant still seems to be a place for an adventurous child to find hidden secrets and exotic places. Back then the wait to sit in the trolley (since removed and replaced with a replica) was over an hour. As a child the mystique of its cavernous faux Tiffany-style glass-enclosed \\\\\"rooms\\\\\" was a wondrous delight that could now only be matched in adult scale by the extravagance of the Winchester mansion of California.\\\\n\\\\nI\\'ve been back 4 or 5 times in recent months and am consistently surprised that for a restaurant that could seat a thousand, I must wait 10 to 15 minutes for a table. Tonight I was making my way back across the cavernous lobby to leave when I was called to be seated. I should have just left.\\\\n\\\\nOnce inside I discover why the wait is so long. Every table as far as the eye can see is covered with dirty dishes and glasses, but no one is sitting at any of them. How long they have been in such a state is anyone\\'s guess, but tonight I was able to sit in the fake trolley and so was afforded the opportunity to see that only 2 of them were cleared throughout my entire meal. What a disgrace! You all should be ashamed of yourselves!\\\\n\\\\nOur server was extremely attentive and did his job with careful precision and punctuality. The only major error was when he kicked a piece of trash in the small walkway between trolley tables to a nearby corner. Oh my God; I just wanted to get up and go over and pick it up. Was that a crust of bread??!?!?! When he first arrived at our table, I asked if he needed some help clearing all these tables. What a disgrace! He told me that when he walked in, there were 130 people waiting in the lobby.\\\\n\\\\nThe food was exactly as expected -- somewhere below the quality of an Olive Garden. I think someone else here may have made the same comparison. Pasta overcooked to the point it can just barely hold its form anymore; meat sauce so gritty you wonder if this is what Manwich tastes like. Meatballs well formed and of overall good taste, but spiced with powdered everything, and old powder at that. Parmesan passed my test with little recognizable filler and of good body. Didn\\'t taste like sawdust.\\\\n\\\\nBread obviously ordered by the hundred thousand, and obviously arrived frozen and partially cooked, Shamrock style, with the finish in a quick-heat just before serving. The cutting boards still have a second indentation for the garlic butter, but none was served. The butter that arrived was nothing like butter, but instead a whipped watery creamy colored stuff that should be the last straw that finally convinces you to throw down your napkin and sue \\\\\"I can\\'t believe it\\'s not butter\\\\\" for false advertising.\\\\n\\\\nThe salad was mostly dismal. The only redeeming ingredient in the entire meal was the olive oil used in the \\\\\"balsamic\\\\\" vinaigrette. I had to take several concentrated bites to try to convince myself that the red-wine vinegar they were trying to pass off as Balsamic was not actually cleaning-grade white vinegar, but the olive oil was really nice. Never mind  the basil or parsley or the whatever-name-you-can-come-up-with tasteless flakes in the dressing that had to be at least 20 years old. Ew.\\\\n\\\\nThere are times when I wish I could go back. I wish I hadn\\'t dined under the artistry of chefs who celebrate the creation of cuisine.

Room was clean and better than expected; although I would say that for a Suite, it was more comparative to a general room at the higher end hotels such as Palazzo/Venetian or Aria. Room included a sofa, dining table, flat screen with bar area (which eventually the sink backed up, see below). Bathroom was decent and there was a vanity area for the ladies. \\\\n\\\\nQuality of towels in bathroom was minimal and for a suite, it would have been nice to have a robe and slippers, but we didn't get that. The shower and toiletries was basic. Overall, the room served its purpose.\\\\n\\\\nOne night we came back from a night out and noticed about 2 cups of black GUNK and GLOB in the bar sink. Gross. We were told it was caused from a backup in someone's else room. He picked up the nasty black glob and we waited for 30 minutes for housekeeping to come and clean it and got too tired to wait up afterwards. They were supposed to clean it up the next day but housekeeping missed it until we called and complained again.\\\\n\\\\nCasino has a variety of slot themes including Michael Jackson, Elvis, Monopoly and more.

I told him that it was my first time here but being from Chicago, hot dogs are almost a food group, so whatever he recommends I am willing to try.  He recommended his signature dog The Pittsburgher.

The menu only offers 6 but I asked Willy if I could just have 3 since it was just me eating them, he very happily obliged my request.\\\\nWhile waiting Willy was sweeping and if he saw that a table had finished he offered to take their garbage and throw it away for them.

As I was there alone he sat and chatted with me a bit about how long I had lived here and typical small talk which was pleasant.\\\\nMy order came out about 8ish minutes later (can't rush goodness).  The perogis were excellent!  They are boiled not sauteed and have a melted butter with a small amount of sauteed onion on top of them.  Yummy in this girl's tummy!  Now on to the main event:  The hot dog!  I didn't add any additional condiments on it so it was a great hot dog topped with chipped beef and melted cheese.  Not knowing what chipped beef was, I wasn't aware how salty it can be, so I do recommend some mustard, sour kraut or something with vinegar to cut through the richness and saltiness of the dog and chipped beef.

Ugh.\\\\n\\\\nAnd even more amusing is the \\\\\"dance floor\\\\\" which is about 75 square feet of space that\\'s roped off in between the bottle service sections.  Lol.  Im not even kidding about the size -- we didnt even realize it was a dance floor at first because it was so pathetically small.  And the reason why the dance floor is so small is obviously because they took up 90% of their space with more ~bottle service~ areas -- there had to be 25 lounge areas in that tiny space -- the greed and desperation is just pathetic.\\\\n\\\\nOh and we never saw Nas,\\\\n\\\\nThe DJ was decent though, except they were already repeating songs 1.5 hours into the night.

Oh, and I had some J.Crew button ups that were brand new, but were marked on the tag from 2007 or 2008, and they were turned down. \\\\n\\\\nUltimately, you're not going to get much for your clothes, but it's pretty convenient. Example:  I sold a Vince sweater that retailed for $195 back in the day.  The store plans on selling it for $38.50.  Store credit means I'd get $19.25, or $11.50ish.  \\\\n\\\\nFor me, I knew after listing fees, PayPal fees, and the time it takes to list, eBay wouldn't have netted more than 10 or 15 bucks on the sweater, so it was worth the saved hassle and instant gratification. \\\\n\\\\nPS: The buyers are really, really nice.  Despite my buyer's knowledge of smaller labels, she asked me what Nanette Lepore is! Bless her heart.\",\n",

I started off in New Mexico my first flight had been delayed 3 different times even before I had gotten to the airport. Thank goodness for those super helpful flight update texts . Seeing that I wasn't going to be leaving NM till very late at night if ever I decided to change my flight. Apparently that was a really bad move on my part. I arrived at the airport two hours before my flight which was supposed to be boarding at 4:30. Once at my gate I see that my flight is now delayed to 5:10. No big f-ing deal , oh just the small issue of the connecting flight that is supposed to board at 5:20 in Vegas .Surprise surprise we finally land in Vegas at 5:40 and I have to run from gate c7 to gate c25. Not only did the guy give me attitude about me being late he wouldn't let me on the plane even though he let two other people down to the plane. At this point I now have to walk up to the counter to discuss what they are going to do about me missing a flight because one of their other flights made me miss my current one. I seriously lost my shit at the counter and started crying like a big baby. They end up issuing me a new ticket once they figured out it was their fault I missed my connection. I go back down the terminal looking like a wreck and head to my new gate. My new boarding time is 8:25, but guess what ! After sitting at the gate for 10 mins the computer monitor announces that flight is now delayed till 10 . Ok then , fine this is nothing new I guess I'm just going to spend all damn day at the airport. But wait it gets so much better !!! It's just been announced that the flight will be delayed till 10:30. The airplane\\\\nIs siting out on the Tarmac but now we have to wait for a crew . At this point have now told my roommate 5 different times she should pick me up from the Phoenix airport . Oh by the way I'm writing this review while still sitting in the southwest terminal at the gate. It's starting to look like I'm never going to get back to Arizona . I'm seriously wondering what the hell the delays are all about ! As far as I can tell there's no awful weather heading for Phoenix or Las Vegas. Let me just say don't fly this airline , don't waste your money. I could've driven home by now. Lastly Southwest get your shit together this is embarrassing!\",\n",

The last thing I want to smell is chemicals while I\\'m eating lunch...well maybe dog poo would be worse.  Anyways, the menu looks great, we place our orders, and they are out of almost every bagel.  It was noon and I thought that lunch would be a major deal there and they would have plenty of bread for the only thing they are serving.  So the sandwiches take forever and we go to pay and I order us each a combo with potato salad and a drink.  This is what the guy at the register says \\\\\"We don\\'t have that.\\\\\"  And then nothing else and just stares at me.  Umm ok so I ask \\\\\"Why is it on your menu?\\\\\"  He looks at me with the most dumb and confused look on his face.  He picks up a menu and looks at it.  Then he says that they have new owners now and this menu is from the old owners.  Well make some new menus dummy!  They are obviously homemade and could be done in 10 minutes.  And how can you not know what\\'s on your menu?!?  Then I ask what they have for sides and he looks in the display case and says \\\\\"We have hummus, chicken salad, and tuna salad.\\\\\"  WHAT?!  Jeez this is weird.  I ask \\\\\"Those are your sides??\\\\\"  I guess it finally clicks in his head what I\\'m looking for and says they have chips.  Ok I\\'ll take chips, just get me outta here, I\\'m getting a headache from the nail polish fumes.  To top it all off, the sandwiches were just ok.  I am not a fan of steaming the bagels.  I like when they are crispy outside and chewy inside, the epitome of a bagel in my opinion.  These were just straight chewy.  And I\\'m pretty sure the place was not very clean.  The girl making the sandwiches was barehanded and answering the phone in the middle of her sandwich making.  Nasty.  \\\\n\\\\nI\\'m sorry for the rant but thank you for listening.  I hope this place can turn it around but it\\'s going to take a lot to get me to go back here for lunch.  Bummer.',\n",

I said yes and when the cleaning lady came to clean, the lobby receptionist personally came upstairs to my room saying that I shouldn't be checking out so late and he was only allowing it because it was christmas, I felt unwanted and unwelcome...we weren't checking out that day, in fact we had just arrived the day before. \\\\n\\\\nThe third night a receptionist saw me struggling with the printer (we were going out that night and were printing tickets to a concert).

So, I turned over my keys and went shopping.  1 hour later I returned.  My car was not done!  In fact, it had only been washed and vaccumed.  So, I talked to the manager and got a vouchure to come back another day and get it finished.  The next day I returned.  I asked to speak to a manager to complain about the time frame, as well as the fact that in an hour my car had not been cleaned.  I was assured by 2 young men (who came up to me and acted like they were managers) that I would be pleased with the end results.  Almost 2 hours later I was told my car was finished.  But, when I got out to my car, i was astonished to find that it was not cleaned any better than a quick wash and vacuum would have done.  The floors were wet, so they obviously cleaned the carpets, but I found spots that had been missed everywhere!  Now, I am a very clean person.  My friends always compliment me on how clean my home is, but my car can get pretty dirty (i have 5 kids and a dog that ride in it daily.)  So, as I looked around I noticed that the door jams where the sliding van doors open and close had not been cleaned, neither had the a/c vents.  I found a toy under one of the seats, a snack wrapper under another.  Nothing had been cleaned to detail!  I paid over $120 for the detail and gas, and felt that I could have filled up my tank and done a better job at cleaning the car for 1/2 that.  \\\\n\\\\nSo, I decided to email the corporate office of Dannys.  I explained the situation and many days later I received a response email.  It basically said that because that person from corporate was not at the location they do not know what happened.  They appologized for it and offered me a regular wash and vacuum.  Are you kidding me?!?  What happened to customer satisfaction?  So what if corporate was not there!  I took the time out to send an email because I was so dissatisfied, that should be proof enough!  \\\\n\\\\nNeedless to say, I never accepted that coupon, nor will I return to Danny's auto wash.

This month, Short Leash was absent, but Pizza People's giant dark green truck was in its place.

While the 12-minute wait might have seemed long for food truck food, and while I'm no expert, the pizza was great and well worth the wait.\\\\n\\\\nMy boyfriend ordered the Popeye, featuring spinach, basil, garlic, tomatoes, and green onions. Luckily, they just happened to already have a Popeye, baked and boxed, and were willing to sell it to us at a discout if we were willing to buy it and wait for my pizza to bake. Of course we agreed, and we treated it as a first course while we waited for my custom sausage, green chilies, mushroom, and black olives pizza.

The cheese had just the right amounts of give and chew. The spinach was cooked, but not cooked to mush. And the true test of pizza, the crust, was crispy on the outside and chewy on the inside, thick and structured enough to hold the toppings up without buckling under their weight. We devoured it, right down to and including the bones (the crust/cornicione), which I too often leave on the plate because it's usually just substandard bread. These bones were truly enjoyable. My pizza came out 12 minutes later, as promised. I personally should've laid back a little on toppings, and somehow, a sprinkling of basil chiffonade made it onto the pizza, but it was still good. However, the crust kept flopping, either because we didn't wait long enough for the pizza to cool or because it was just floppy crust. After the Popeye, I want to think it was because we should've waited just a little longer to dig in. I still really enjoyed it, though, and look forward to visiting the truck again--hopefully it will be a frequent vendor at First Fridays, Food Truck Friday, and Saturday at the Downtown Public Market!\",\n",

I guess the obviously short 8 yr old minion that is with us looked like an adult. SMH.  After we were seated and got food, the quality of selection seem to have dropped from last year. It seemed more simplified, nothing fancy.  Our waitress (plate cleaner more like it) was also oblivious to my hand sawing the prime rib I got with a dull knife, after she had stopped by 3 times and I was already almost done with my prime rib I finally gave up asked if there were steak knifes and she said \\\\\"yea\\\\\".  Eh, after seeing my husband and I both having prime rib on our plates, wouldn\\'t the first visit to our table ring a light bulb to get us steak knives anyways!?!  \\\\n\\\\nFood quality has gone down, the selection of unique food seems to be less.  I did not see some of the other dishes that they had 9 months ago.  For $115 for the 3 of us and the experience was very disappointing.  For that price I\\'d rather just go to a steak house and have better food.

We met with Dru and went over menus options and pricing and amazingly everything fell into our budget. We decided on a self serve Italian type dinner and the price per guest was very reasonable! And it also included the free soda, coffee and tea (which no other place was offering and was a big selling point for us!!). \\\\n\\\\nDru and the team were amazing. My husband and I couldn't have asked for a more perfect wedding day. Everything we asked for was done.

It's 3-frigin'-30 in the afternoon, and they're already out of the lunch special?!?  How about taking down the sandwich board outside so more people don't get rooked into buying a meal that's twice as expensive as they planned??  FYI, they didn't take down the sandwich board.  I ordered something else, and it was decent.  And how do you run out of Mexican food?  Everything has the same ingredients, it's just packaged different.  And this was a basic burrito.\\\\n\\\\nStrike 2 - None of my beers were comped.  Whoa whoa whoa, what??  Is this Russia?  This isn't Russia.  Really, is this Russia?  What bar doesn't comp beer for playing?  I've been to one or two in my life, but they let you know up front.  \\\\n\\\\nSo I lost money in the machine (as I expected), paid for my beers (not expected when playing), and bought a lunch that was twice as expensive as they advertised (never crossed my mind that would happen).\\\\n\\\\nThis La Salsa either intentionally rips people off by LYING that they don't have a certain dish left, they have terrible business practices, or they are incompetent.

       "        'This review is for their first preview performance.  I am taking into account this was the first show before an audience.  That being said, what i saw last night was an OK show with some promise.  It\\'s in the PH Showroom on the second floor of Planet Hollywood Hotel and Casino.\\\\n\\\\nThe show begins with good use of the large LED screen installed for Peepshow years ago.  There\\'s a black and white video of Sydney, Australia with views of the Harbour Bridge and the Sydney Opera House along with some skyline shots.  The video continues until the day turns to night and the lights of the city are on.  That\\'s the beginning of Sydney After Dark.  It\\'s a nice video to introduce the ladies from Australia.\\\\n\\\\nThe show starts with lead vocalist and MC, Natalie Conway, singing an opening number and the nine girls coming out from archways on the stage that have hanging crystal lines.  \\\\n\\\\nFrom there, the show continues though a number of traditional topless show scenes.  While not named, I have my descriptors for them--the naughty school girls, the cowgirls with whips, the nurses with the male patient (audience member), a classic showgirl kind of act, and some others.  In between, there are two aerial acts, a woman performing with some silks and another act with a woman doing tease like moves riding in a hoop above the end of the runway center stage.  The women are not topless all the time which is fine.   Except for most of the singing, the music is recorded.\\\\n\\\\nOne of the things that needs looking after is transitioning scenes.  The three school girls were almost in their seats when the spots were turned on and two stagehands with their headsets were still on stage from moving the desks into place.  They hurried off the stage.  The transitions need to be done in the dark like all theatre so the lights come up on the women, not stagehands.  This same error happened a second time near the end of the show.\\\\n\\\\nAs for transitions, there were times that the people sitting around me and I were not sure an act had ended.  When the dancer(s) started walking upstage and the lights dimmed, we then knew that this section was over but there were times when I wanted to say, \\\\\"Huh?\\\\\"  One section that did nothing for me was the sole ballet dancer.  It\\'s not needed and It didn\\'t add any tease or seductiveness to the show.\\\\n\\\\nThere was also a number where three ladies dance one behind the other to Indian sounding music and move their arms and legs like Hindu gods are depicted.  My suggestion would be to move the ladies closer to each other to add to the idea of one being having multiple arms and legs.\\\\n\\\\nTIP:  Do NOT buy the most expensive seats in the floor section near the stage.  When the theatre was redone to accommodate Peepshow, three walkways were built out from the main stage and many times the action is taking place behind the person sitting up close.  There were some unaware that there was a woman in a hoop above and behind them until the lights got their attention.  And there are times when those same people turned around to see not topless women but the rears of the topless women.  Be aware of that when you buy.\\\\n\\\\nThere are a number of deals available for discount tickets--a Groupon and a code on the Sydney After Dark Facebook page.  The show is OK.  It can be better and it needs to get better if it\\'s going to succeed.  This theatre has chewed up and spit out a number of shows.  This could be just one more.',\n",

Honestly, it wouldn\\'t have mattered much except that I made it a point to ask about shellac and one of the nail artists said that its just another top layer that they use to protect the nail polish!?!?!?!\\\\nObviously not true and the fact that I specifically wanted my mom to get shellac made me a bit upset.\\\\n\\\\nHAIR CUT and COLOR- A cute stylist colored and cut her hair and she tried to be polite and all and I appreciate that.  However, she seems to lack styling and coloring techniques.\\\\nShe is proficient in cutting though and her technical skills show it.\\\\nColoring- was straight forward and simple since my mom\\'s hair is really short.  There were a lot of mess around her forehead and neck but it wasn\\'t to the point of excessiveness.  As for styling she was holding the hair dryer very awkwardly and it was up her chest so she couldn\\'t manuver it easily and had to push up onto my mom\\'s hair in order to try and style it.  we pretty much stoped her and said it was fine so we can leave.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nWhen it was time to pay, the lady seemed confused in how to charge me since I had a groupon for the shellac and also had other service.\\\\nI was told $45 for cutting and coloring special when I originally booked appointment but was instead charged $59.\\\\n\\\\nWhen we were done, there wasn\\'t much of a goodbye.

My bf decided to order something different then the usual thinking it would be different right? Wrong! We get the cole slaw pickle and frie like we would on the smoked meat sandwich special (he ordered the main  platter) the cole slaw was green. And tasted like oil and old. Why would you changed something thats been here before you were even born?! So we asked and they said they changed it but really what they did is use the regular cole slaw that they used to serve and just added some green stuff to it to give a different look.. youve been in this new restaurant for 2 months now dont start changing things on the menu. Then one of the waitress comes to the table to ask US what we orded to she van see if its ready.. i just wanted to pick up my things and leave. Since when do i have to tell a waitress that works in the restaurant what i orderd? You know it works wth numbers.. our table was 31 go ask the origInal waiter who took our order and check with with the kitchen. after a long wait my bf recieves the \\\\\"main platter\\\\\" sliced smoked meat slopped on the plate. When you say \\\\\"main platter\\\\\" you expect it to look like a platter. We could have ordered the main special and it would have been the exact same thing only the special comes in a sanwich and not on the plate. So now I still didnt get my food. I orded the burger. It was good but my meat was white. I didnt even bother to ask why . Finally she brings it and stands there and appologizes like over and over again. Keep in mind we never complained once!

Who does that? I literaly had to wait outside so that the staff can go in and out with the food because obvipusly we were in the way.

He said they didnt want to give it to him..now I got fkn mad I come to your restaurant spend my money order extra to take to go and you cant even give me a fkn brown paper bag?!?!?! Is this a joke?? I went up to the owner asked him for a paper bag he had the nerve to roll his eyes and gave me one. Normaly I would blast him but you know what they dont give a shit. They think by buying something classic like this that they can just walk in here and change things around is going to work? No its not.

       "        'I met Nate from Innate Dog Training thru a friend 2 yrs ago. I was so impressed at how well behaved his 5 dogs were since training with Innate Dog Training. I have 2 Bloodhounds and had been thru 2 previous trainers. The first claimed to be the \\\\\"Dog Whisperer of Las Vegas\\\\\" He was NOT!!!! After hundreds of dollars and failure, we were referred to Sitmeansit training. They basically made my Male Bloodhound aggressive by using a shock collar on him. Again after Thousands of dollars wasted. I decided to give Nate a try as my last effort. Well HALLELUJAH!!!!!!!  Finally someone who knows what he is talking about. Our first meeting with Nate was him teaching US how to use the leash and collars, so basically the first session he was training US, we ALL don\\'t think we need training but we do. After the first session, I made a call to Nate a few days later because my male bloodhound Gunner (with the aggression) came at me. Nate met me that day and away he went with Gunner. He had Gunner for a month, but called to give me updates, the day he brought Gunner home, I was shocked, I could of sworn it wasn\\'t my Gunner, but it was and the results were AMAZING!!!! The aggression is gone, He now has respect for us. We can walk him and Gabby without them dragging us down the street,they stay right by our side, they both know Sit, Down and stay along with other commands. They both now do 2 hrs of down- stay a night with no problem. Those who know the bloodhound breed know that this is unheard of,  they are a very Stubborn breed, but this is what you get with Innate Dog Training, proven results. I 100% recommend Nate to anyone who is looking for a kind, patient and knowledgeable trainer. He is well worthy every penny spent. Plus your training is not done after your session, he offers group training on saturdays to those who complete training with him, so you keep on learning and so does your dog. Nate also offers boarding, which is nice because you know your dog is in good hands while you are way and they are getting their daily walks and training. Thanks Nate for taking the time to work with us and our kids. We now have kids that we can enjoy daily!!!!!!',\n",

You can order either chicken, steak or beef tacos, (3 taco minimum) for a dollar, and you get a side of fresh tortilla chips and you get to choose from their salsa bar. \\\\n\\\\nThe chicken tacos are definitely the best, the chicken is flame-broiled and you definitely get that flame-broil flavor.  They are on double corn tortillas which is a bit much for me, I can never eat more than two (which is why the three taco minimum kind of sucks, but who can beat $3 for lunch with leftovers?).  The steak tacos are nothing compared to the chicken, the steak just isn't very flavorful, I definitely would not recommend them.  I have never tried the beef, which come on a crisp taco shell.  I tend to prefer soft tacos over hard tacos, so I haven't really been interested in trying the beef.  \\\\n\\\\nI think the rest of the menu tends to be a bit expensive for what you get.

I had them once or twice a week- so long story short- I know gyros.\\\\n\\\\nHaving a craving for gyros in Vegas is hard. You just can\\'t find it GOOD out here. So after reading the reviews I decided to give Greek Bistro a try.\\\\n\\\\nI ordered the gyros sandwich and Greek fries combo. At $8.99 without a drink it is quite pricey, but I also realize that all the gyros is shipped in from Chicago- nobody makes it in the west, so cost will obviously be more.\\\\n\\\\nThe sandwich was not exactly what you would get back east. First was the sauce. Now you are supposed to get \\\\\"Tzadziki\\\\\" sauce which is a thick yogurt based cucumber sauce that is very light and tasty. I don\\'t know what my gyros was drowning in, but my best guess is some sort of modified ranch dressing. It was a thin runny sour flavored ranch dressing. I took the sandwich out of the tray and the stuff ran out all over.\\\\n\\\\nThe gyros meat itself was OK but not nearly as much on the sandwich as you would hope for $9. Also on the sandwich was a few leaves of romaine lettuce ad literally 3-4 strands of onion. Chicago style is loaded with onions.\\\\n\\\\nAlso, the gyros slices were very uniform. This tells me they don\\'t carve it from their own spit and probably buy it pre sliced. The texture and taste of gyros right off the spit is far superior.\\\\n\\\\nMy only other gripe was I originally wanted to eat in, but after seeing the flimsy looking blue plastic chairs in the dining area (I\\'m a big guy) I decided to be safe and just take the stuff home.\\\\n\\\\nOK, I have to give them at least one good note.

       "        'Recently had a rehearsal dinner there for my sons wedding our total party had 25 people.  My biggest complaint was there wasnt enough food served for everyone at the table to try everything.  We were seated at one long table and the food was brought in and placed mostly at the ends.  By the time the serving plates reached those in the middle they were pretty much empty and the servers didnt bring anymore food.  Also cheesecake and cannoli were to be served for desert.  There was only enough cheesecake for half the guests and the rest had to have cannoli.  Really dissapointing.  Also, the food on the whole was just so-so...pretty much on the level of Olive Garden.  Im not a fan of \\\\\"family style\\\\\" plating so with so many other choices for Italian around town I dont think I will be coming here again.',\n",

       "        'If I could give Alaska Airline 0 stars I would. With all of the Airlines that i have flown with, my worst experience would be with this Airline.  First, our flight was canceled in Seattle so we decided to call reservation while waiting to  talk to a customer service agent in person.  I was a little hesitant with the customer service agent because I saw the way she was servicing the person before us. Of course no smile, no nothing, she dreaded our existence as if she did not want to be working. I asked her about our flight and she had no clue it was canceled due to maintenance, she basically told us she couldn\\'t help us so i ask for a supervisor. The supervisor at the station had the worst attitude in customer service that I have ever encountered, believe me when i said that i stayed calm the whole time.  The supervisor did not know the reasoning for the canceled flight either until she paged someone. Her rude attitude was no acceptable. We had an event the moment we land and had to be in the Las Vegas Convention center right after so our urgency to get on the next flight was not a concern to them. I asked if it was possible to get on the next available flight or another airline, they did not want to help, they did not give us any options, no nothing. Noted the cancellation was due to maintenance and not weather related but they felt like they don\\'t have to take ownership for it.  As to many other airlines they understand that maintenance is under their control and would find ways to help their customers.  The reasoning for not helping us was of course we are not a \\\\\"diamond member, as she stated something close to that.  We asked if it\\'s possible to put us on stand by for the next flight, she finally did, and after we took a few steps away form the counter we heard the supervisor gossiping about the situation, yes very professional.   Feeling uneasy about the experience, the night before leaving Vegas we got down to the conference room in our hotel building  and realized they had screwed up our flight coming back from Vegas to Seattle. Of course, with the service and screw up they have given us in Seattle, we were not surprise at all. When we called reservations they tried to place the blame on something else! What a sh!t show. Alaska Airline can not take ownership of their own companies fault, they pass it around to anything that they could to make their company hold that image of being the better airline.  The no good agent and supervisors in the Seattle Airport was a joke, Please fire them. Terrible work ethic and customer service.  They represent your company and if this is the face of Alaska Airline why should we choose your mileage card compared to other Airlines? Especially with Alaska Airline\\'s terrible service? We shared this information inside the Las Vegas Convection Center with several people and will be sharing this terrible service to many more, for even though we are not your \\\\\"Diamond members\\\\\" we are still your customers. We made the mistake of choosing your mileage program this past year. and now we know better. We know we fly frequently enough to know better that service should not be this terrible.  It was a big surprise for us due to the fact that Alaska Airline should be one of the best and from this experience, it was the worst out of the 8 flights i have taken this year.',\n",

Now im white also but I lived with a mexican family for 6 years so I know what REAL mexican food is and that  is what I expect when I go to a mexican restaurant,That didnt happen here and I will never go back here.....to eat that is!  so if you like totally Americanized mexican restaurants you may like the sandbar but if you actually know what real mexican food looks and tastes like your going to be very very disappointed with this place!',\n",

We feel it's socially and environmentally responsible to choose recycled goods, when it makes sense.   This being said, we are very familiar with our choices for purchasing recycled goods.  This store is on the bottom of our list, not because of the goods that they sell, but because of the attitude of their staff.  Case in point.  I did a little experiment at this store.  \\\\n\\\\nFirst Visit -  Dressed down.  You would think I donned an invisibility cloak.   No service!  And the little  interaction I did have was outwardly snobbish. \\\\n\\\\nSecond Visit -  Dressed up.  What a different experience.  I received a friendly greeting at the door and the level of service was much better.   Don't get me wrong, they were still very arrogant, but the level of arrogance was much lower. \\\\n\\\\nSo every experiment needs a second set of results.  Here they are:\\\\n\\\\nFirst Visit - Dressed Up.  Same experience.  Greeted at the door.  Snobby but responsive service. \\\\n\\\\nSecond Visit - Dressed Down.  This time was even worse.

I was still within 5 feet of the same sales girl when she pleasantly greeted the well-dressed women that entered right after I did.  What am I, chopped liver?    \\\\n\\\\nSince this little experiment my experience has remained consistent.   I prefer to dress down, beach casual.  And every time I visit My Sister Closet in Paradise Valley, I'm treated like dirt.  I'm really sick of this place and over time have shopped there less and less.  I just can't take being treated so poorly.   Whether I appear wealthy, or not, should have no bearing on how I'm treated!   One never knows who they are meeting and cannot, and for that matter should not,  make a decision about a persons level in life based on appearance alone.   In my world, people are not discriminated against based on gender, race, religion, or social status.  I think I've had enough!\\\\n\\\\nATTN MY SISTERS CLOSET STAFF:  You cannot use stratification to determine your level of service.  You cannot judge people based on appearance.  You want to service only your wealthy customers while ignoring the rest.  WARNING:  Your assumptions have you failing on all fronts, including your attempts at trying to service a higher end clientele.  Have you not learned, the eccentricities of wealth create a very wide variety of appearances.   Regardless, to base your customer experience on perceived social class is just wrong!   You are alienating all of your customer base, because in the end,  no-one likes an elitist snob.\",\n",

I've been to New York itself several times, and the exterior and interior design of this hotel represents the city quite well.  \\\\n\\\\nSo if you are craving for a taste of New York city, then head on over to New York-New York.  Besides playing at the casino, I also enjoy playing in their Arcade.  Yeah, I am still a kid at heart.

       "        'I\\'m left with a very bad taste in my mouth after a recent stay at Talking Stick Resort.  My family and I decided to surprise my Parents with an Executive Suite for their 30th Anniversary.  Let me start off the the positives.  The check-in process was very easy and the lady who checked us in was friendly and accommodating.  She gave us a room on the 11th floor at the end of the hallway with a great view.  My Husband and I spent awhile decorating the room for the anniversary and put a dozen roses and a \\\\\"happy anniversary sign\\\\\" and other decorations we bought in the room for the big surprise.  My Parents loved the room.  They said it was quiet and liked waking up to the awesome view.\\\\n\\\\nMy MAJOR problem came the next day when we were getting ready to check out.  We met up with my Parents for brunch before checking out.  They packed their stuff up and left it in the room as we requested, and were granted, late checkout.  After brunch we all went up to their room to get their stuff and arrived to a clean room and ALL the decorations we had given them were gone including the dozen red roses, which were just purchased the day before.  Housekeeping had come before they checked out and completely took everything out of the room and left only their bags.  My mom wanted to keep the flowers (which were brand new) and all the decorations we had given them.  These items were stolen out of the room and probably just thrown away.  All that was left was an empty vase - why would someone do that??? I considered this stolen property.\\\\n\\\\nWhen we went to the lobby to check out I informed the lady about the items, which were taken out of the room by housekeeping.  I expressed my dissatisfaction and she contacted housekeeping, who did not return her call.  Meanwhile, my family (six people) sat waiting for 20 minutes.  Finally a manager came out and told us they could not do anything about these stolen items unless I filled out a report, as this is their \\\\\"policy.\\\\\"  Since everyone was waiting and already upset I just left, but seriously that is ALL they could do???  I spent over $500 at this resort between the room, dinner and Orange Sky, gambling, and drinks, and $30 worth of my property (roses and decorations) were just thrown away without cause.  Why would housekeeping clean a room when late checkout was requested???\\\\n\\\\nAll in all, I am EXTREMELY disappointed in this resort.  I live in town and have been here multiple times, but will not return again unless someone addresses this issue.  Customer service should be a priority, not an after thought!',\n",
       "        'I came there last summer for  my Fiance\\'s Birthday in July after watching Phantom of the Opera. We were served by a gentlemen by .. I believe his name is Lance. After making our  drink and food orders. I saw the staff singing happy birthday to a little girl. I then asked Lance if his staff could do the same for my fiance since it was his birthday. He told me he was going to see what he could do. So after having our dinner we got our frozen hot chocolate. And I flagged lance down and asked why they didn\\'t sing happy birthday.. ... he said he didn\\'t do it for anyone no older then 12 yrs old! I was like (WTF) are you serious?! He then goes on to say \\\\\"you can sing him happy birthday and I can give you a candle\\\\\" So when he got the candle he yelled out \\\\\"everybody lets hear it for this guy it\\'s his birthday today! and said \\\\\"now you can sing him happy birthday\\\\\" and walked away! My fiance and I looked at each other like omg! Seriously WTF was that? I would have given him ANY STARS! On our way out of Las Vegas we had called the next morning to complain to a manager to let him know what happened and Mike told my fiance that Lance tends to do what he wants at night but he was still supposed to accommodate us for what we wanted (So basically he refused to do that service for me! what a Jerk! ) and Mike apologized and told us to come in that night for a complementary dinner on the house. My fiance told him we were about to board a plane to go to CA. at the time. So Mike said the next time we were be in town to Look him up! ... So in October of last year we went back and spoke to a fairly new manager and told him of our experience and gave us a great server by the name of Lori. She was very helpful in helping us decide which foods were good, and she was from were we originally were from was San Jose, CA. She knew exactly what mall my fiance and I worked at and what area it was in! How cool was that! She did a way better job than Lance did tending to our needs and always checked up on us to see if we were doing OK. That\\'s the kind of customer service that people should always get which is the reason why I gave 3 stars.',\n",
       "        \"It's not that I wouldn't tell people to go here but this is what I would tell you. 1. Do not ever go here with a pregnant woman. We went here for our anniversary and I am 6 months pregnant. They sat us first in a tiny little booth, my belly was already touching the table and I began to get claustrophobic. I have never seen a booth so small in my life. It is a total design error. Private booths yes, not tiny private booths in a cubby in the wall--so uncomfortable. We asked to be moved, which I really felt for a place where we were spending that much money should have probably noticed that I was pregnant and found me the best most comfortable seat in the house--instead they found us a table with torturously hard chairs. Then they told me the big surprise that this is a 2 hour dining experience--a 6 month pregnant woman cannot sit in hard chairs for two hours--again someone should have noticed this and offered a better seating. I tried to brave it, in between the painfully slow out lay of tiny courses--again not fit for a starving pregnant woman--for about 2 hours, finally after several trips to the bathroom just to get the feeling back in my legs my husband had to ask to be moved again to an obviously better spot next to us--an open, normal sized booth with a cushy seat. I liked our waiter, very friendly, and the chocolate fondue at the end of the endless fondue was to die for. I'd go back and specify that I want a normal sized booth and probably just get the cheese fondue and chocolate. The other entrees were okay, but bring me out my food not in a trickle feed. By the end we had spent 3 hours there, had to move twice and I was just exhausted by the end and we paid over $130 for the whole thing. I've been to nicer restaurants and paid as much for more caring service perhaps and amazing food. It was alright, but again there's just a lot to know about the melting pot before you decide to spend three hours there. If you're looking for a romantic time with just some light eating and conversation then that's what this place has to offer, but men before you bring your girl there make sure to request a normal booth, and maybe think about ordering a la carte if you don't want to wait hours for your 4-course meal to be done.\",\n",

The atmosphere is good to hang out and watch some sporting events with friends or just chill and talk.

I wish Mac's Speed Shop did it this way.\\\\n\\\\nIt has a really cool bar area.  Like a lower-key Twisted Spoke if you've been to one in Chicago.  If it were in a slightly different area I'd expect it to be more of a biker bar.  They have a huge parking lot and even a covered bicycle rack which is more considerate than most  places.  And the spanking new juke box looks like it hasn't been put to much use yet.\\\\n\\\\nThe food is a step up from Burger King in taste.  Twice the cost of fast food but still half the price of a restaurant like Big Daddy's or The Counter.  So for value and atmosphere it's great.  A fine place to score a quick meal and go about the rest of your day.  It's a family burger joint with hot dogs and a kids menu, and a casual sports bar rolled into one.\",\n",
       "        \"Poor business practice!  I posted a comment on here yesterday about the crappy service I received in Fort Lauderdale at the kiosk in the Galleria Mall, but Ghost Armor continues to remove it when I repost, obviously to cover up any negative practices so the only thing that people see here on their Facebook page is the good stuff.  Too bad that the posting wasn't left for people to understand that the full disclosure isn't being provided, prior to closing the sale, as to how the replacement plan works.  The kids who work at the kiosk in Fort Lauderdale pitch the product, but they DON'T tell you that you have to return the old Ghost Armor film to get the next new one for $5.00.  So, I go to get the new one after the old one had been removed and I'm told that I'm out of luck.  The guy was really rude and blew me off with an attitude.  I contacted the corporate office and was told that I should have read the fine print on the sales receipt (buyer beware, they tell you all the seemingly good stuff, but don't tell you the important stuff).  So they pitch the sale and suck you in and then you're on your own.  Very bad, and it felt like part of the excuse from the Corp office was that the Florida mall kiosks are privately owned, but if I would go home, get online, complete a registration process, then call the corp office back again they would issue a warranty or something, then GO BACK to the mall to the rude punk... yeah right, I don't think so, for a piece of plastic!\\\\n\\\\nI would NEVER return to a Ghost Armor location or purchase this product EVER again.  If the corporate office blames the privately owned franchises and don't hold them to a high standard, then the problem is at the corporate level.\\\\n\\\\nLet's see how long this post is left before they remove it again.  Well it lasted 4 minutes the last time.  Ghost Armor is removing my post as soon as I repost it because they refuse to let anyone say anything negative, instead of resolving the issue, they prefer to hide a single complaint.  Bad business practice again Ghost Armor.  You brag about your product, but don't stand by good policy and allow your franchise operators to tarnish your reputation, which I don't think there is much of a reputation here because if anyone says anything negative you remove it.  Sneaky and disreputable.\",\n",

Its the execution that needs a lot of work. I used to come in here a lot. And two years ago I probably would have rated it a lot higher than I am rating it today. I heard about this place from a family member and how you can bring in books you don't want anymore and get either store credit or cash. OMG! That is the best idea ever. Getting rid of something you don't want and then picking something out that you do! What a concept!

I don't mean that it was mild...but it had no taste.  Plus, they didn't put a lot of sauce on, so that half my sandwich didn't have BBQ sauce on it.  :-(\\\\n\\\\nNormally, when I eat at a BBQ place, they have additional bbq sauces either in squirt bottles on the table, or in a vat somewhere in a central location for you to add on if you would like more.  There is also usually some kind of variety to choose from.  Tangy sauce, maybe a hotter bbq sauce, etc.  All I saw was a vat near the napkin area, but it wasn't labeled and I didn't trust putting in on my food.  I didn't know what it was.  I assume it was extra sauce, but I don't know that for sure since there wasn't a sign.  \\\\n\\\\nAlso, the place was FREEZING.  Look, I'm from Michigan and have a pretty thick skin for cold.

I am a little bummed that I came with my wife, requesting a king bedroom, and was bumped to a double because the group i was with had a group rate, which apparently means second-class guests. The mattresses are either old or poor quality (or both), as both of our beds had lumpy body impressions on the sides and a rise in the middle, resulting in a less than perfect sleep for us both each night.\\\\n\\\\nThis place is dog friendly and kid friendly.

There is a swim-up bar which was a fun touch.\\\\n\\\\nThe only food onsite is Tagglia which was underwhelming, generic Italian food, forcing you offsite for better options. I never took advantage of the spa amenities, but the courtesy shuttle was convenient  and appreciated.

       "        'We are avid spa-ers and make it a point to visit the spa at every hotel we stay at in Vegas. We stayed at the Venetian last weekend and visited Canyon Ranch and can say we were not that impressed. We were excited based on the reviews we read and photos we saw but were underwhelmed. First off, the spa does look outdated compared to the others we have visited. After changing into our robes and showering, we went to see the different rooms. First, the steam room is too hot. I am one for sweating it out but the steam in there was so hot that it hurt to breathe and burned our noses. It was too intense. We thought to try the Igloo room right after to cool down and that was TOO cold. In other spas, such as Qua, the ice room is a nice cool room with cold temperatures and no cold water pouring on you. This however was basically ice cold water raining from the ceiling. It was unbearable. Next to those 2 rooms was your standard jacuzzi which was again, too hot. There\\'s jacuzzi hot, and then there\\'s boiling pot hot. This was the latter. I will say that the lounge chairs by the jacuzzi were heated and comfortable. More inside was a standard sauna which was okay. No complaints there. But there are two rain showers there that simulate tropical forests, Caribbean storms etc. Again, cold water pummeling down on you from different directions. That pretty much sums up the spa portion. \\\\n\\\\nWhile waiting for our treatments, this is where the \\\\\"outdated\\\\\" theme comes back in. We were taken to a tiny room with chairs stuffed inside to wait for our masseurs. I never got the idea I was in a spa, but instead a doctor\\'s waiting room. Just the overall feeling was not spa-like at all. \\\\n\\\\nI received the hot stone massage and I have to say, this made the experience worth it. It was one of the best stone massages I\\'ve received. However, one minor complaint was that I paid for an 80 minute massage and got a 60 minute one. They were 5 minutes late retrieving us and ended 15 minutes early. At that point what are you supposed to say? \\\\\"Get back in here?\\\\\" So we let it go. \\\\n\\\\nIn order to see the conservatory, the wave room, and the other rooms advertised online, you have to go to the Coed area. This is where your masseurs pass through to take you to the treatment rooms. This is where things get better. The wave room is very tranquil and quite and so relaxing. There is also a spa shop and teas and fruit. \\\\n\\\\nThe worst part of the \\\\\"ordeal\\\\\" was dealing with their inexperienced, inefficient, and lack of staff. Typically, we take care of payment before entering the spa. This did not happen. They put our receipts to the side only to retrieve them at the end of our day. Not only that, but they had 1 person at the front, with a second going in and out. They do not communicate well between shifts. When we went to pay, they couldn\\'t find our vouchers nor our appointments. At this point, there was a line of 7 people being assisted by 1 person. Overhearing other guests\\' issues, the spa charged a gentleman\\'s birthday gift from his kids to him, which was supposed to be covered on a voucher, thereby no longer making it a present and also lost a woman\\'s voucher completely, making her contact the issuing party to clear the bill.\\\\n\\\\nOverall, I was not impressed with the professionalism of the staff nor the spa itself and will not be returning. But if you do, be warned.',\n",

The problem is I usually look around a bit and go home with maybe a bit more than I expected.\\\\n\\\\nObviously in a store that carries as man better name close outs in as small a place as it is, one does have to keep a sharp eye out, and maybe do a little digging.  Who cares, treasure is to be found.  I have found this store to be infectious.  Every time I go there I seem to find a better price on something than the time before. Be it something for the yard, gifts for the kids, entirely to expensive sheets for the bed, crystal, monogrammed thank you note's, something for the my cat, Picasso, they are all there and waiting..  I took a friend there the other day who complained they didn't have prices like Goodwill.  The truth is this person is not a shopper and never will be.  If you are a shopper, you'll recognize the quality is at prices that make sense. \\\\n\\\\nAnother minor but really nice thing about the Tuesday Morning stores is the music they play when you are there.  At major dept stores you hear music that has been selected by a team to maximize sales according to critical factors.  The owner of Tuesday Morning picks the music you listen to.  I like his taste and usually find myself humming a tune at some time before I leave which is usually with more than I planned on.\\\\n\\\\nI will talk about the service which is unique to this store.  Depending on the lines of customers waiting to be rung up, they may or may not greet you as you come in.  Usually I find they do.  If you just aren't finding what you are looking for, you might have to to be the one to seek out  one of their people and ask them concerning what you are looking for.  At this point, I am usually very afraid.   They are going to steer me to an area where even if I don't see what I asked for, something will be there that will work.  I just have to decide which or how many!\\\\n\\\\nI haven't discussed the wonderful yellow Clearance signs have I?   I look at prices that really can't be beat on things that I probably will use for some thing  at some time.  If I can't see why they are marked down, or there is a flaw that I can live with,  I have this good habit of buying them.  The result is I never really have to shop for the holiday, birthdays or you name it.  I  dig in the back of my hall closet closet and usually something is there that will suffice.  Tuesday Morning is truly one of the stores that helps keep that closet well stocked.  \\\\n\\\\nVisit this location.  It is worth me starting the great American novel on shopping?!?\",\n",
       "        \"We picked this place because...#1 we love Brazilian & #2 we had a discount from last minute tickets.  My husband and I ate at this place expecting a similar experience from other Brazilian places we have been too but that wasn't the case, I will but say it's horrible but they played it safe with the meats...others places have offered us alligator, chicken hearts...and here we had none of that. We were offered alot of beef but who can a argue with that right? Now the thing about it, is that we were impressed alot more with the salad bar...the roasted vegetables were delish and these cheese biscuits they had were incredible.\\\\n\\\\nIf you eat here, get the discounts that you pay $3 per person at Last Minute tickets.

To die for.\\\\nI started with the curry soup, quite good, with just a hint of spice. The sushi served was fresh and the portions (especially the sashimi) were quite large. My first experience at Moto? Overall excellent.\\\\n\\\\nSadly, on my second visit, I encountered a hot restaurant (eeew, raw fish and a hot environment?) with mediocre service. We arrived at 12:30 and attempted the All You Can Eat Sushi, two full hours later we had eaten exactly about two rolls and two nigiris each. minus soy sauce for the first order since we never got our soy sauce bowls. We were told the AYCES would take about 15 minutes to prepare when in actuality it took just under an hour for each order. \\\\n\\\\nWe watched as two different families sat at a table across from us and left after waiting for about 10 minutes to give a drink order, nobody ever came.  \\\\n\\\\nFinally, this little grandpa with his two grandsons came in they, like us waited and waited. the grandfather told the server he felt he had been waiting too long (45 minutes), she offered an apology and sent the manager over who began to actually argue with the man, she actually asked if he had ever eaten at a sushi place before.  Excuse me? Not professional.  Then tried to tell him that the server had placed his order only 20 minutes earlier. He was confused as he had ordered a good 40-45 minutes earlier.  The manager, again, argued with the man telling him he didn\\'t order 45 minutes earlier.  \\\\n\\\\nBottom line: AYCES is horrible, we actually overheard the manager tell the man \\\\\"The AYCES is prepared AFTER other regular orders, regardless of when placed, so that customers who order order off the regular menu get their food hot.\\\\\" Really? So the sushi chefs are also in the kitchen preparing soups and noodle dishes? Not likely.  So, take the 18 bucks, add on the automatic 20% gratuity and you\\'ve got yourself a meal a little over 20 bucks a piece and you\\'ve only eaten 5 pieces of sushi.  \\\\n\\\\nI will not return for AYCES, but for a dinner?

       "        \"Upon booking the Tropicana for a recent trip to Vegas, I scoured Yelp and Trip Advisor for reviews. I have to say, most of them are dead on so I wasn't hit with any big surprises when we arrived. I emailed Nicole a few weeks prior to our trip to let her know we were celebrating a birthday and to request a room in the Paradise Tower, which is closest to the strip, as well as a fridge (which isn't usually included in Las Vegas rooms) to keep our alcohol and water. She was extremely friendly and accommodating and took care of us right from the start, even including the fridge free of charge!\\\\n\\\\nWe arrived around 2PM on June 14 and luckily for us, no line up at check in. I was expecting the coconut scent that everyone talks about but I have to admit, upon entering it hit me like a ton of bricks! It's pretty strong and sweet smelling, but after a while you forget it's even there. We were greeted by Terry who was absolutely fantastic in ensuring we had everything we needed, he was so funny and friendly and took care of all of our requests. Our room was ready immediately which was great!\\\\n\\\\n Once we got to our room I was SO impressed. It was great size with a HUGE, comfy bed, great view, big (updated) bathroom, iPod dock, flat screen TV, and the temperature was just right. Unlike some other reviewers, we had no issues with our AC and even found it to be a bit chilly! We did have a small issue with the fridge not being delivered right away, but once I called the front desk they took care of it. Everyone we encountered at this hotel was great, from the housekeeping to the front desk to the restaurants and casinos. The small gift shop in front was perfect for picking up some energy drinks and Pepto Bismol and the overall feel of the hotel was bright and inviting. I have previously stayed at Planet Hollywood and Monte Carlo, but I actually enjoyed the more low key aspect of this hotel as it was a calm escape from the craziness in the middle of the strip. Everything was within walking distance, which made getting around extremely easy. We were so happy to return 'home' to our hotel at the end of the day. Perhaps my only complaint is the lack of ambiance in the evening. During the day, the bright white decor of the hotel is LOVELY compared to the darker, dingy hotels on the strip. But in the evening it felt weird. The pool was FABULOUS, we had no issues finding spots and the drinks were perfectly cool and refreshing!\\\\n\\\\nUnfortunately, we did not spend too much time at the hotel nor did we check out the shows or restaurants (with the exception of Starbucks and Beach Cafe), but it looked like it had a ton to offer. I was fortunate enough to enjoy the spa and it was GREAT! The staff really go above and beyond at Tropicana, even tweeting me and calling up to our room to wish my boyfriend a Happy Birthday. Overall, I really enjoyed this hotel. I have an issue with everyone complaining about the resort fee. This is typical in Las Vegas and almost all of the hotels do it. If you don't like it, stay somewhere that advertises NO resort fee! Otherwise, don't complain. We were prepared for it and we used the pool facilities as well as the free wifi so it wasn't a big deal to me. Great job Tropicana!! I will be recommending this hotel to my friends and family!\",\n",

You must pay extra for a lot of condiments/extras that typically come with your meal.  However, I do tend to like food a little on the plain side so I really enjoyed my sandwich.

Sweet green chile cornbread drowned in this chunky salsa type stuff with shredded pernil.  I didn't know what pernil was before but now I cannot do without it at least twice a month.  Fuego's is so tender...so flavorful.  And on top of this cornbread, its just absurd.  I could eat this anytime, any day.\\\\n\\\\nSpeaking of pernil, the first thing I had here was the Pernil Torta.  Actually, a coworker let me taste a little piece and I ranted on that whole day about how good it was.  Its just that it has this specific taste that my grandmother's pork ribs had.  I thought I'd never get that taste again, and who knew it'd be at a Mexican place.  The only complaint with this sandwich is the bread...i don't like it.  It doesn't...go.  If this was on texas toast, i would be eating one right now.\\\\n\\\\nI've also tried the tacos and the nachos.  Both offer a lot of food.  The tacos are on par with any good taco I've had.  The nachos are huge and got a lot of different good flavors going on.  I'd recommend either.\\\\n\\\\nMy second favorite thing to get here are the empanadas.  The only empanada i ever knew anything about was Taco Bell's desert ones.  These ain't that.  These have beef, cheese, peppers, stuff, more stuff and some other stuff in this perfect pocket crusty flaky thing.  And there is a sweetness to it all that makes these irresistible.  I am always torn between these or the cornbread.\\\\n\\\\nThe value is normal downtown stuff.

You'll probably have leftovers (yeah right).\\\\n\\\\nThe staff are always friendly, although they are really busy all the time.  I've had to stand around a lot even after waiting to come in after I call ahead.  Standing around wouldn't be so bad if the layout of the place didn't suck.  This is another booties-in-my-plate type setup, where customers have no choice but to hover around diners and their meals.  No matter where you stand, you end up dancing the cha-cha trying to get out of the servers' and other customers' way.  The drink station is right in a high-traffic area, so everybody is in everybody's way all the time.

So, I went out of my way one day to pick up some food and a bubble tea -- even though I wasn't hungry.  Their menu was very extensive with a mixture of japanese and chinese -- you know, all the typical dishes you'd expect.  I ordered a hibachi chicken with a milk tea bubble tea!  While I waited for my to-go order I checked out the buffet. It offered sushi rolls, rice, soup (egg drop, I think) crag rangoons, egg rolls, etc.  Even though the buffet did not entice me, I was looking forward to my meal.  The bubble tea was very good but a little too watered down.  The ice had obviously melted too much.  The pearls were pretty decent.  Definitely some of the best that I've found in Charlotte (although, that's not saying that much).  I took my meal home and enjoyed it.  The chicked wasn't cut hibachi-style -- the cubes do make a difference.  But, the flavor was good.  However, later that night, I did not feel very well.  I'm not sure what it was about that chicken and rice, but something really upset my stomach.  So, I'm giving this place 3 stars because of the bubble tea.  I probably will not eat here again but if I'm in the area, I'll stop in for some bubble tea.  I recommend this place for those with strong stomachs.\",\n",

First off this restaurant is DIRTY. We were seated inside in one of the upper booths. One of the first things that I noticed was that the tile surrounding the booth was covered in dust. First bad sign. The second thing I noticed was that the stained glass windows beside the booth was covered in sauce splatters, ew. There was also a partial hand print in a white sauce on the side of the tile next to me double ew. Unwrapped my silverware and there was a large chunk of tomato and rice attached to my fork. Don't know how that even happens. Makes me shutter to think what they think is passable in the kitchen if they miss dried food on the utensils.\\\\n\\\\nI should have probably thought twice about eating in an establishment so dirty but against my better judgment I ordered food. The chips and salsa were just okay. The chips did come out warm but the salsa was very watery. We ordered an extra side of hot salsa but our waiter continuously forgot to bring it until we had already eaten half of our meal. It was not really worth waiting for, it tasted like taco bell hot sauce. The service was bad. It started off okay but our waiter was more and more forgetful throughout the meal. I had originally ordered a fireball shot but after about fifteen minutes had gone by and no drink, my fianc\\\\u00e9 informed one of the other passing waiters that I still had not received my drink. Our waiter showed up in the mean time and asked what it was I had ordered again. He comes back five minutes later and informs me that they are out of fireball. I proceeded to order an extremely over priced $7.99 margarita (usually $8.99). It was decent.\\\\n\\\\nThe food. Mediocre at best. I had a Baja chicken enchilada and a cheese enchilada. My fianc\\\\u00e9 had a bean burrito enchilada style. The Baja chicken enchilada was pretty good. The Baja sauce has a great flavor but I don't even want to think about how many calories a white cheese cream sauce has in it, it is a once in a few months indulgence but the other food does not make up for the calorie boat of this sauce. The cheese enchilada with red sauce was just meh. The red enchilada sauce tastes generic and too heavy. My fianc\\\\u00e9's bean burrito was luke warm inside. \\\\n\\\\nWe got the bill and I had been charged for the fireball that they were out of. It was removed ten minutes later.

It is a fun quiet place for a nice lunch or dinner.  It as a great atmosphere.  It is not Paris but remember you are in Las Vegas.   i had the onion soup to start out with which was one of the best I have ever had.  I then had the Croque monsieur for lunch which was truly outstanding.  For dessert I  had the Tarte Tatin which was very well presented and excellent.  As with most first class Las Vegas restaurant the service was great.  I think Las Vegas really understands how to hire friendly restaurant staff and train them well.  I have another business meeting here on Friday afternoon and cannot wait!  If you visit this restaurant you will not be disappointed!',\n",

I've been going here since I was a little girl and I swear that good 'ol burro get's better every time. I've also had their shredded beef tacos, chimis, enchiladas, and there chips and salsa is tasty. I've had their wonderful horchata and they have the best ice ever!! Is that weird...? If you go you'll know. It's like Sonic ice. It's run by a family and I see the same workers in there every time. I love getting to know them through the years, such a nice family. I do think the taco's are average, good, but average. But that burro... Bean's, cheese, x-tra cheese, and sour cream. Pour the salsa over the top and add some limes. Yummm!!!!

       "        'Never ever again! \\\\nZero stars!\\\\n\\\\nWe arrived late on Wednesday night 07/24 around 11pm or so.  We were told there are no non smoking rooms left, and despite booking one it is merely a request. This is supposed to be the hotel with the most rooms in Vegas. After getting upset, the guy spoke to his manager and miraculously \\\\\"found\\\\\" a room.\\\\n\\\\nUpon entering the room - it smelled... It was bad. The carpet was filthy... So much so that when my son took off his shoes his socks turned black.  The comforter on one of the beds had stains on it. \\\\n\\\\nAt this point, rather than complain, I figured I would just make do. It\\'s late and it will get better right? So I simply remove the comforter cause I generally don\\'t use it anyway. \\\\n\\\\nThe next morning when I wake up, there is something uncomfortable under my sheets bothering my back... What is it? A large bottle cap, in between the sheets and the mattress. So does that mean the sheets were not removed when the last guest stayed here?\\\\n\\\\nThursday, we left the room early in the am around 10am  Or so and  returned around 3 pm. The room was not cleaned yet, so we left. They had almost 6 hours to do so, and it wasn\\'t done? Well it\\'s a big hotel, I can get over it. We came back around 6, and it was finally done. Once it was finally done, guess what? The comforter was still there! Big surprise. So again, I just kicked it to the floor. \\\\nOn Friday, we returned again around 3 or so and it wasnt cleaned. When housekeeping came, we sat in the room while they cleaned the room and even tipped her $5.00. I didn\\'t even bother pointing out the comforter since I won\\'t use it, I just asked for 1 extra towel. \\\\nAgain, I usually don\\'t complain. But I did watch her change the sheets. \\\\n \\\\nFriday night, we went to bed around 11. The connecting room next door was making a horrible amount of noise at midnight. Shouting, laughing, music. Me, my wife, and my kids could not sleep. We called the front desk and they took care of it. It started again around 2 am. I called again. And again they said they would take care of it. \\\\nIt is a little after 4 am now - and guess what? They are doing it again. I call once again and  am assured it will be dealt with. Of course, we have not slept all night. And the woman on the phone offers us a food credit for our inconvenience. \\\\n\\\\nAre you kidding me?\\\\n\\\\nWe come to Vegas 4 times a year, literally. We have stayed all over the strip. We are also a family that travels a lot.\\\\nWeekend trips, long vacations. So we know hotels. And honestly, we haven\\'t had an experience like this bad before. \\\\n\\\\nThe funny thing is, I\\'ve been to this hotel\\\\nMany times before to eat,\\\\nBecause it houses some of the finest restaurants   in town. And I assumed that since that is the case, the hotel\\\\nItself must be pretty amazing. L\\'altilier, Robuchon, and Craft Steak are 3 of my favorite restaurants  in Vegas. I\\'ve eaten at each place multiple times. These restaurants are simply too good for this place. \\\\n\\\\nThis hotel  is  horrible. And the worst part, No one cares. \\\\n\\\\nI check out in a few hours, and I will definitely complain. \\\\n\\\\n5am now and the guys next door are banging on something. I have come downstairs to complain to a manger - cause clearly calling 3 times doesn\\'t work. There is no one here, and the guy went back to get his manager... It\\'s been almost 10 minutes. \\\\n\\\\nDo yourself a favor, don\\'t stay here. I know I won\\'t be returning.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nSo last night, the night manager Cesar promised to comp the night that I had the problem with the unruly neighbors. This morning I go to the front desk to double check... And guess what, not only did they not do it, but allegedly they can\\'t because I prepaid through a convention group I came with. All they can do is offer me a free upgrade upon my next stay (no chance in hell that will happen). They have to go through all the convention attendees accounts, all 6,000 of them, before they can offer a credit to the convention group who will then credit me. BS. Absolute crap. The day shift manager told me,  don\\'t store cash and we have no means of crediting your credit card.... So this casino that deals in millions of dollars a day can\\'t give me $189.00? Why didn\\'t she just tell me the truth which is \\\\\"we at MGM grand would like to say F-U and think you for your shitty stay!\\\\\"',\n",

With that being said the manager which was a Japanese female came out towards our table and said \\\\\"before you start talking let me say what I have to say first\\\\\"... really?!! My sister-inlaw told her finally that she just wanted to pay her bill and leave then the manager said all the way across the restaurant \\\\\"yes you will pay your bill and never come back\\\\\" this was in front on everyone that was in the restaurant!! The bill was separated into 4 checks there was 6 of us, gratuity was places on all checks which was 10.00 so our bad server would have gotten 40.00 from us.. yeah right!! I would suggest to upper management that they train this particular servers and so called manager how to do their job right!!

Having grown up in a family that (in addition to pizza) also makes pierogis from scratch, I found their version very fair to midland--just passing. The problem I guess for me is that a regular potato pierogi should not give one heartburn, which I took as a sign of too much grease used in the cooking. \\\\n\\\\nAlthough the restaurant does provide a nice atmosphere to gather a group, I must add that the last time I met some friends there it smelled keenly of petting zoo.

Called them back to get someone out, they were supposed to come yesterday and canceled on us, and no showed on us today. We paid a ridiculous amount of money to have a washer and dryer just sitting in our house. They have beyond wasted our time.

Disgusting! Lava sauce tasted and smelled really bad and expired like it was left out for a few weeks. I ALWAYS order a side of lava sauce so i know what its supposed to taste and smell like. My Fiery Box order was not in a \\\\\"BOX\\\\\" and just thrown in the bag, Not a big deal but they could\\'ve at least wrapped it up properly, the produce fell out and was all over in the inside of the bag. My cherry limeade tasted like they poured cough syrup into it.\\\\n\\\\nI drove back to Taco Bell to make a complaint. I asked for the night manager and  spoke to some Hispanic guy, I didn\\'t get his name. Told him about the hair in my salad and was very inconsiderate, condescending, and rude. He acted as if I had put it in there. He said \\\\\"why is the hair perfectly placed in the middle? I know we didn\\'t put it in there\\\\\", I wanted to hit the guy and shove his head up where the sun don\\'t shine. I have nothing to gain by placing a piece of hair on my 4 dollar salad and driving all the way back their, I know I wouldn\\'t  get a million bucks back,  I didn\\'t even want a refund I just wanted to bring it to their attention. Even if i had intentionally put the hair in the salad, customers should be given the benefit of the doubt. I was honest and told him I placed it in the middle so I could take a picture of it and post it on yelp for everyone to see. DUH!? It was difficult to take a good picture of it the way the hair was positioned in the salad. One of the employees said he was sorry and I said  thanks and that obviously your manger isn\\'t sorry. The manager gave me a refund for only the Salad and the cherry limeade and not the entire order. If I was the owner of this establishment I would\\'ve refunded the entire order and even gave some kind of coupon for a free meal or something. The manager told me to leave and to never come back.

Please don\\'t punish your customers. If you have an issue, bring it up to them right away. We\\'re paying anyways. If anything, put it in our bill anyways and we probably wouldn\\'t even notice. I understand it was our fault for trying to avoid the gratuity (which is 18% for 4 or more. That\\'s right 4 people. A freaking family with 2 parents and 2 children would have to pay so much extra). But I honestly believe it was because we were young looking. I extremely hate that stereotype. Just because we are young adults DOES NOT MEAN WE DON\\'T HAVE MONEY.

I explained to her I had a higher pain tolerance, and personally need pressure to have it feel relieving aka good- she explained to me that to have high pain tolerance wasn't good, and pressure isn't necessarily good.  Not saying the customer is always right, but I was seeing a chiropractor at one time after a car accident for about 6-9 months and the pressure was F'n amazing, so I beg to differ with her practice. \\\\n\\\\nSo in regards to the tactic. After you're done with the massage they have you sit down with another individual who goes over the 'form' that you explain your issues that you checked, ya know the ones stating; neck pain, pinched nerves, low back pain, etc.\\\\n\\\\nI told her I really didn't have any problems or issues, it's just at random that the pulled muscle comes in here and there. She provided me with a voucher to come in for a free 20minute massage, free dr exam and free xrays. I wanted to decline the appointment bc to be quite frank I know how it works. They suck you in and advise you have a 'plethora of issues' and to correct these issues you need to commit to a series of appointments. I have a few friends whom do massage whom I trust to be in their hands and a regular monthly massage will be good for me. Not knocking the chiropractor at all, but the tactic seems to be a vicious cycle. Just saying.\",\n",

That seems inexpensive however when you compare it to prices at the pool bar where my husband\\'s Bacardi Diet Coke was $15.  \\\\nSpeaking of the pool, there are 2 pools which have a very simple shape. Nothing special about them.  They are holes in the ground filled with water.  Even the Flamingo has a nicer pool.  I would also recommend Caesar\\'s, the Mirage, or the Cosmopolitan pools over this one.  \\\\n\\\\nThe spa:Not worth purchasing a day pass because there isn\\'t much in there. It\\'s old and the them is obviously left over from when this hotel was the Aladin.  This theme no longer fits this hotel.  The services do not follow the theme either like I have seen them do at many other Vegas spas.  Services are WaY Overpriced!!!!  Even for a Vegas spa.  Believe me, I have been to Qua @ Caesars & this is nowhere near as nice, but they still charge over $200 for a facial.  AnD . . . You are paying that much and the staff acts like they couldn\\'t care less that you are there.  other than the \\\\\"nameste\\\\\" greeting you receive when you walk in the door, they do not make any effort to make you feel appreciated, special, etc.  \\\\n\\\\nFacial itself was excellent, but I was asked if I\\'d like to have microdermabrasion and glycolic application during my facial.  I said, \\\\\"sure.\\\\\"  Next, she tells me it was going to be a $20 upgrade charge.  She asked if that would be alright.  I agreed because I was using comps anyway and already spending over $200 as it was so what\\'s another $20, right?  Well, when I went to check out, the guy @ the front desk said the upgrade was $25.  I explained to him I was quoted $20, but he insisted it was $25 & that I had already had the treatment and that I would need to pay for it.  I tried fighting him on it one more time but to no avail. \\\\n\\\\nWe came to this hotel with the intention of using our $1000 comp dollars so we charged everything to the room.  Our final bill for 2 days was $644.  My husband checked out while I was finishing up at the spa.  They told him our comps covered all except $103 of our bill.  They charged our credit card the remaining amount!!!!  What?!?  We should have had more than enough comps.  So, my husband tells me this when I get out of the spa as we are driving away from the hotel.  I couldn\\'t believe it and immediately called to try to resolve this.  The lady on the phone said the same thing . . .   All comps on both our players club cards had been used.  I could not believe this.  So, once we flew home, I looked online today and I still had $430 left in comps on my card!!!  What kind of idiots do they have working there?!?!  So, I called again TODAY and finally got someone who saw the comps and agreed to refund the amount charged to the credit card and instead take the $103 out of my comps.  \\\\n\\\\nSuch a stressful trip there was more frustration than fun.  My advice would be not to go to Planet Hollywood unless you want to be surrounded by a staff who doesn\\'t give a shit that you are there from the valets to the bellmen to the waiters to the dealers.  They really don\\'t care about you which is unfortunate since you are forking out a lot of money overpaying for subpar quality everything.  You would think that would at least buy you a little respect.',\n",

It didn\\'t appear that they had anything else tomato juicey on the menu, but I think I may have ordered the wrong thing.\\\\n\\\\nAnother big huge highlight that really surprised me was the jalapeno biscuits and gravy.

Don\\'t get me wrong, I may pass by during the day and scoff at them, but, by the end of the evening, I\\'m beer-ponging with the best of them! There are women here though. Suprisingly. Sorority girls and cougars mostly. \\\\n\\\\nThe drink specials are pretty good. There\\'s a happy hour between 8a-8p, I think? Better than a lot of the Hotel bars. I couldn\\'t tell you what they are, but, there is a Leprechaun that serves up shots on the bar while blowing a whistle. \\\\n\\\\nThe tables are usually packed (as well as the whole place) during the weekends. They say they have $2 blackjack, but, you won\\'t be able to find it. No pai gow either. They do have a little poker room, enough for 4 tables. As well as some at the open air entrance. \\\\n\\\\nOh, and there\\'s a 24hr Burger King inside that serves perhaps THE best Jr Whopper this side of the Mississippi, at 4a.',\n",

The lamb in the gyro is so delectably tender and well seasoned that nothing even comes close...anywhere. We're from NYC and have had a good gyro here and there but this really kicks butt. Not to be outshined were the kebabs. Seasoned to perfection and moist! The portions and price are just right.

       "        \"Although it's been awhile since I've been here, I've visited a few times on various occasions in the past.  Needless to say, the atmosphere is definitely the most unique aspect of this place.  As others have mentioned, the place is a decommissioned Catholic church.  The seats are pews, and the brewing apparatus is located where the altar used to be.  For this reason alone, it's probably the most unique place in PGH to grab a drink.\\\\n\\\\nHaving said that, I've generally been underwhelmed by the quality of the food here.  Although I can't recall details because it's been awhile, it just hasn't wowed me, whereas I would expect it to be gastropub-quality, given the atmosphere and the price point.  Fortunately, every time I've gone, someone else has picked up the tab.  As for the drinks, you're pretty limited if you're not a beer drinker, like me.  They do have a few wines to choose from, but again, I haven't been blown away by any of them. At a microbrewery such as this, I understand that beer is the star of the show, and I expect to be limited in my drinking options, but I would at least hope that the munchies would be good.  Given the popularity of this place with out-of-towners due to its novelty, I'm sure I'll be back at some point, but otherwise, I wouldn't go out of my way to come here, based on my experience.\",\n",
       "        'My meal here turned out to be a very odd experience.\\\\n\\\\nThe good: \\\\nI was greeted and seated right away, a glass of water and menu were provided immediately.  The water was refilled expeditiously.\\\\n\\\\nWhile it didn\\'t smell as fragrant as Pho Nhan did when I entered, it did smell good.  \\\\n\\\\nI saw a mix of Asians and others (including one not-too-polite redneck farmer who talked way too loud on his cell phone at the table) but enough of the former to feel this was a popular place for Vietnamese.  I wouldn\\'t trust a pho place full of only white people.  Scary thought.\\\\n\\\\nThe eggrolls were delicious!  They were more garlicky than ones I\\'ve had in the past and it was that kind of garlic that you keep taking bites of and wanting more of.  The veggies were fresh and crisp, the shell was crisp and delicately flaky, the dipping sauce was perfect.  I could have eaten a whole meal of just these.  \\\\n\\\\nThe bad:\\\\nAfter being seated and provided water and menu I was summarily ignored for at least 15 minutes.  THIS I\\'m not used to.  Someone else would have left.  The waiter was sitting a a table in full view of me about four tables away and purposely did not make eye contact or walk by, much less come to my table.  What\\'s the problem, Dude??\\\\n\\\\nWell, you know what, I can usually out-stubborn anybody, though thankfully don\\'t often need to, so I decided to sit there till Hell froze over.  Eventually an older man came out to bring another table their food.  He saw me sitting there, hands politely folded on menu, smile on my face, obviously ready to order, snapped some orders at the younger guy, who then came over to take my order at long last.  I got the aforementioned eggrolls and a bowl of soup that included duck leg and bamboo.  My phone died before I could take a photo of the menu as I sometimes do to remember the name of the dish.  The guy checked with me if I wanted the one with bamboo and I said yes, but my antennae went up.  As he was leaving the table he hesitated and asked, \\\\\"You work over there?\\\\\" Pointing to the west.  I told him no, I was visiting from San Diego because I had a new granddaughter.  He brightened up at that and was perfectly nice after, so I can only guess he thought I was someone else initially, someone not worthy of his attention.  Working where?\\\\n\\\\nAfter eating the delectable egg rolls and being extremely impressed, the large bowl of soup arrived and emitted such a putrid smell I didn\\'t know if it was from the person serving it or the dish itself.  It honestly smelled like someone had pooped in it, or in their pants nearby.  I told myself not to let my imagination run wild, thinking of stories describing slaves who defecated in their owners food, ewww. I had gone through so much to get it that I didn\\'t want to send it back.  As I took bites and spoonfuls I pretty much narrowed it down to the bamboo being the culprit causing the bad smell and taste.  And it was not inedible, just took some getting used to.  I kept telling myself I probably had just never eaten bamboo before and maybe it\\'s an acquired taste like Limburger(sp?) cheese, or liver.  Whatever, I ate it and while I barely made it to my motel bathroom after leaving the restaurant (don\\'t ask), I had no further  gastronomic problems from the food, and that could have been caused by eating exotic food after having nothing to eat all day.  If the food had been \\\\\"bad\\\\\" I\\'m sure I would have reacted to it during the night or next day.\\\\n\\\\nI\\'m trying to talk myself into giving them three stars because those egg rolls were so good but the more I remember sitting there being purposely ignored, the more I acknowledge how impolite and unprofessional that was so I\\'m going to make it two stars.  Sorry guys, next time tend to your customers.  I eat out every day and this place is very near my motel so I would have loved to add it into my rotation of eateries.',\n",
       "        '1.5 average? Really? It\\'s Burger King. In the back of O\\'Sheas. By the bathroom. C\\'mon guys... why the hate?\\\\n\\\\nIf you make it to this part of O\\'Sheas, you know, the back part with the beer pong tables and the Subway and the weird Taco place and the punching bag strength machine, what really are your expectations of a BK? What are you expecting that would warrant more than 2 stars? Complimentary champagne perhaps? Red carpets? Kim Kardashian behind the register? \\\\n\\\\nI don\\'t remember the last time I came to O\\'Sheas and made it to BK without being drunk. O\\'Sheas doesn\\'t exactly carry the holier than thou attitude that most of the other bars and lounges on the strip do. So, most everyone here is drunk, almost drunk, hung over or drunk. Oh, and hungry. Enter this Burger King.\\\\n\\\\nIt\\'s pretty cheap food. Considering how much the entrees are at Hash House a Go Go next door at Imperial Palace is, or the Cafe at Harrahs and Burger Joint at Flamingo (all within walking distance of O\\'Sheas and open late), the food here is a steal! We all know that, which is why we walk all the way to the back of O\\'Sheas to this place. It serves its exact purpose. Provide cheap, fast and greasy food. And for that, they should be admired not admonished. \\\\n\\\\nSo what if you get the runs the next day. It\\'s probably from all the alcohol anyway. So what if the employees look like the \\\\\"after\\\\\" shots of Faces of Meth. So what if the food takes longer than registering your car at the DMV. It\\'s vegas, relax.',\n",
       "        \"Being as this is a hotel, I will break down my rating as follows:\\\\n\\\\nBed comfort - 4 stars\\\\nCleanliness of room - 1 star\\\\nLocation - 3 stars\\\\nValue - 2 1/2 stars\\\\nCasino - 2 stars\\\\nRestaurants - 3 stars\\\\nStaff - Varies greatly\\\\n\\\\nOkay, so my sister absolutely loves this place, or at least did before this visit. In Vegas for Xmas with my sister and brother-in-law I stayed at the Gold Coast out of convenience because that's where they were staying.\\\\n\\\\nFirst things first, the location is off the strip on Flamingo, next to the Rio and directly across the street from the Palms. It is relatively easy to get to the strip and they have a shuttle if you don't have a car. Other than the Rio and the Palms though, there really isn't anything worthwhile close to the hotel. You definitely aren't staying here for the location.\\\\n\\\\nThe bed was comfortable although a little hard. I prefer a softer mattress.\\\\n\\\\nThe housekeeping however was atrocious! After the first night I left my room at 10:45am. When I got back to my room at 4pm the bed was not made. I thought that they somehow didn't get to my room yet, but then I noticed one (but not both) trash cans had been emptied. The towels had been replenished but there was still a towel on the floor of the shower. The toilet paper had the little arrow thing that they do with they clean the rooms. So obviously they had been in the room, cleaned half of it and then stopped? What the hell?!?! \\\\n\\\\nI had to go down to the front desk to complain. They sent someone to go finish the room. When they were done, the table clearly hadn't been wiped down and there was a water stain on the bathroom door which was probably there before and I just didn't notice. Unbelievable! I stayed there 4 nights. The table was never cleaned, not one in 4 nights and neither was the water stain on the door.\\\\n\\\\nThe linens on the bed were clean, but one piece has a rip on it and the sheets were too small for the bed. It was an embarrassment. There were also stains on the carpet.\\\\n\\\\nThe hotel does NOT have an in room safe, which most hotel/casinos in Vegas have.\\\\n\\\\nThe Gold Coast is absolutely NOT a resort, yet insists on charging a resort fee. Completely unacceptable, although as least it is a smaller resort fee than most hotels. The resort fee includes incredibly slow internet. You can pay more for faster internet, but if you are going to charge me a resort fee that includes internet you have no right to charge me more for faster internet. I was constantly waiting for pages to load and videos to buffer. It was horrible.\\\\n\\\\nOnce in the casino, there are a decent selection of table games. Nothing special unless you are a Pai Gow fan. I have literally never seen so many active Pai Gow tables before in my life. The slot selection is very poor.  This was incredibly obviously when I made my way to the Aria and saw all kinds of machines that the Gold Coast was lacking.\\\\n\\\\nThe restaurants were okay. I never hit the buffet, but they have 2 Asian restaurants and a TGIFridays which were fine. One of the Asian restaurants is Ping Pang Pong which they advertise has having been called one of the 100 best Chinese restaurants in the US. It is good, but always ridiculously busy. Expect a wait, even at 3pm on a Monday afternoon.\\\\n\\\\nThe biggest problem occurred on Sunday night. My sister is mobility impaired and had rented a scooter to get around the casino. Sunday night we left the hotel to go to dinner and left the scooter with the valet. They didn't tag the scooter and while we were at dinner the company she rented from went to the casino, saw her scooter there without a tag and took it. The hotel let them and then when we got back from dinner, nobody could tell us where the scooter was. More than 2 hours later my sister had to rent another scooter, at a higher cost, and the hotel refused to do anything for her even though it was clearly their mistake. They didn't tag the scooter and let the company pick it up without checking or signing anything. My sister who stays there A LOT and spends A LOT of money in the casino was told by the night manager that he didn't care if she ever came back. If she's smart she will never walk (or scooter) through their doors again.\",\n",

Being gluten free, the gravy and yorkies were off limits but everything else was fine for consumption. \\\\n\\\\nIt was \\\\u00a318 so \\\\u00a39 each and it was fantastic! The chicken was amazing - I had been offered some alternative sauces on the side (mustard, etc) but the chicken was so beautifully moist and the veggies cooked perfectly. The meat just fell of the bone and it was so easy to carve that there was little mess. Myself and Caz were both stuffed and the remainders were wrapped for Caz to take home. Y and J both enjoyed their kebabs - both the king prawns and the halloumi and veg looked lovely so next time, I'll possibly go down the kebab route.\\\\n\\\\nI actually like the rustic interior. I know many places are going with themes - chrome/dark wood then the inevitable wooden chopping board, but here there is lots of wood, the gardening theme continued throughout and our chicken came in it's own little veggie box. Staff were really friendly and our server was lovely - even bringing Tanya's sticky toffee pud complete with a candle. I've given it four * but this may be revised to a 5 soon - I was on soft drinks last night so I've yet to try the wine list or cocktail list but the range of beers looks good. Just something a bit different from what other places are doing.

She works in the wedding industry and Megan- the owner I think-took such great care of her so it was a tough place to forget.  I am now a bridesmaid in my cousin\\'s wedding which is in california and found out they had the dress she wanted us to wear for her wedding, so I decided to go and support this cute little business since I had seen what great customer service they offered and the pricing seemed to be the same as what the gals in California were paying even with the bridal party discount.  \\\\n\\\\nI went with my mom for the initial dress shopping and we had an ok experience, nothing mind blowing but both my mom and I figured that maybe they were just having an off day.  I just left my fitting today and again just left underwhelmed.   When scheduling the appt I got a little attitude over the phone about trying to get in with my busy schedule and having to get in with their seamstress; but again just burshed it off as them maybe having calls coming in and customers around so they just needed to get my appointment set and off the phone to help others.  \\\\n\\\\nToday I showed up at 10:56 for my 11am appt and the gal gave me \\\\\"the look\\\\\" as I walked in the door and I immediately spat out that I had an 11am appt hoping she\\'d be more welcoming, she said they didn\\'t open until 11 and it would be just a minute.  I kept out of the way and took a seat in the parlor area and just waited patiently, a couple minutes later she set me up with a dressing room and I got all set up with the seamstress who was there for another fitting but since the seamstress I was supposed to be with wasn\\'t there she took the appointment. When I walked out in the dress no one said anything, not one word about how it looked or fit, they just asked if I wanted to get it hemmed. I\\'ll never where the dress again most likely, but a compliment might have done a little something for my self esteem.\\\\n\\\\nWhen I originally ordered the dress my mom paid the first portion with an Amex and today I went to do the same thing with their card-being in several weddings this year it is getting quite expensive so mom and dad said they\\'d foot the bill for the dress :) - but now they no longer take Amex and they can\\'t start alterations until I have a different method of payment.  I get that I do they own the dress until it\\'s paid for in full but it would have been nice to know that prior to showing up.  When they called to schedule the appt they had my information in front of them I\\'m sure and it\\'s the same sheet they had out today I\\'m guessing which clearly showed that my first payment was with an Amex, plus it still says on their website that hey accept all major credit cards. :/ \\\\n\\\\nI know I\\'m not a bride but I am a customer and this is a unique business you all are in and I had seen such amazing service with my friend last year and I didn\\'t think it would differ much when I went in for my bridesmaid dress.  I think the thing that frustrates me is they aren\\'t thinking beyond what\\'s in front of them, as consumers we have so many options so its not very business savvy to make these kind of interations go south.  Every girl that walks in that store has potential to be a bride or know a bride in the near future, why not capture new clients simply by making any of their interactions anything but lovely.  I know I will be getting married in the nearby future-hint hint bf get the ring out ;) and all of us ladies plan and think about what we want to wear and maybe where we will get to go dress shopping to find the perfect dress, but it bums me out that simple and fixable interactions has made me give them just an okay review.  They have great pricing, cool location, fun accessories and have been in the knot the past couple of years so let\\'s hope they take this review as a gift and work on making each of their customer\\'s experiences a memorable one...hope to be on here again with something more exciting to share!',\n",

Specifically a gentleman named \\\\\"Jaime\\\\\". \\\\n\\\\nOne week ago my husband and I came home to an AC unit blowing warm air. We called the emergency line, since \\\\\"no air conditioner\\\\\" is considered an emergency. The gentleman called back 30 minutes. He stated because it was dark there was nothing he could do until morning. So we shut off the system. toughed it out until morning. The next morning he came in and explained to us it didn\\'t work because it was off. We tried to explain we intentionally turned it off. But when he turned it on the air was reasonably cool so we accepted that answer and chalked it up to our error. \\\\n\\\\nLast night when I got home from work it was 83 in the apartment again. We waited until morning to call because of our experience with being told there was nothing they could do at night. \\\\n\\\\nJaime came this morning, said something about a blown fuse and that it was fixed. When I got home from work again this evening, it was again 82 in the apartment and blowing warm air. \\\\n\\\\nI called emergency maintenance again. This time before dark. 30 minutes later (after dark) Jaime called again telling me he already came and it worked this morning. I explained I appreciated that but it was very hot again and made a point of calling before dark. I asked him at what point do we need to involve a professional? Someone who specializes in air conditioners and he lost his patience with me. Accusing me of calling him unprofessional. I stated I only meant it was obviously more complex than he initially realized. He at that point reminded me he already fixed it and I must be doing something. At that point I asked to speak with his supervisor since we were obviously not communicating correctly. He told me he did not have a supervisor. I then asked who he reports too ... And he said \\\\\" you\\'re going to report me?!?!!\\\\\" And I rephrased again just indicating I wanted to elevate the situation being he was accusing me of not correctly using an air conditioner. At that point he started speaking so quickly I could no longer understand him. I ended the conversation by stating please come as early in the morning as you can since this will be the second night of no sleep due to the uncomfortable temperature. \\\\n\\\\nI hate dragging people through the mud, or naming names specifically in my negative reviews but in the course of a single conversation I was made to feel I was not smart enough to properly operate an air conditioner and I don\\'t understand how apartment management/supervision  works. \\\\n\\\\nThis is unacceptable. He made no efforts to offer assistance in the form of fans/portable air units or vacant apartments. Instead choose to belittle me for inconveniencing him on a Friday night.\\\\n\\\\nI hope that MC properties makes this right because I expect much much more from such a large property management company.\\\\n\\\\nUpdate?

The red chilli burrito:\\\\n--First I'd like to mention that we did in fact NOT receive the red chilli burrito, but instead we were given the chicken burrito with green chilli sauce. It had a spiciness to it, but eventually we stopped half way and decided it wasn't worth it after looking at the rest of the meal.\\\\n\\\\n2. The shredded beef tacos.\\\\n--The beef didn't taste bad, but the tacos weren't even crispy! not to mention the box was FULL of grease at the bottom. YUCK!\\\\n\\\\n3. The rolled chicken tacos.\\\\n--Obviously they had been double fried. Most likely a wrong item from a previous order or was cooked by accident and then pulled out again when the item was ordered. Full of grease, overcooked, tasteless meat... not to mention the guacamole that came with it was already slightly turning brown.\\\\n\\\\n4. Mini chimis\\\\n--I ordered cheese and got a mixture of half cheese and half some sort of mystery meat that I couldn't determine what it was. I ended up cutting these up and feeding them to our dog, to which I discovered that these were also most likely double-fried and also seemed to be getting old as the meat was appearing to change color.\\\\n\\\\nAll in all, we are EXTREMELY disappointed!

       "        \"The arena is fantastic.  It's not only well themed, but well balanced and offers great gameplay.  The packs are lightweight and very comfortable for people of all sizes.  They were in good shape and fairly accurate.  They have an observation deck, which is a nice touch.  \\\\n\\\\nMy biggest complaint is that there were way too many people in a game.  The field is large, but 36 players is too many people for that sized arena.  People were crashing into one another, and it was impossible to walk more then a few feet without being shot from someone somewhere.  It didn't make the game very fun.  \\\\n\\\\nThey started most games before everyone had a chance to enter the field, which was annoying.  \\\\n\\\\nThe other problem is the timing of the packs.  When you're shot, your pack shuts off for 5 seconds like in most other lasertag systems.  However, at this site, your lights will come back on and you'll be vulnerable to be hit 1/2 second before you can fire back.  There's no rule about no following.  This means that you can stalk someone and prevent them from ever shooting just by shooting them in that vulnerable last 1/2 second of their 5 second down time.  I'm sure this is software controllable.  Why they would choose to run their games this way is truly baffling.  \\\\n\\\\nThe last issue I had was how they make the teams.  Rather they having red and blue areas of the briefing room and allowing players to see who's on what team and choose what team they want to be on before suiting up, teams aren't decided until they enter the briefing room.  Staff were alternately assigning every other player to the red or the blue team as they entered the vesting room, which made it impossible to play on the same team with others in your group. \\\\n\\\\nIf you want to have a birthday party here, I'm sure they'll have a fun time.  I recommend coming on a weeknight or early on a weekend when it's slow.  Don't come here on a Friday or Saturday night when they're busy unless you like playing mosh-pit lasertag.\",\n",

We each got either a miso soup ($6) or house salad ($8).  Don't get the miso- it's the smallest bowl ever!!!  The salad however was really good and fresh- the dressing was really flavorful.  We got the royal sushi sampler ($300) which had a few rolls, uni, ikura, and a selection of sashimi.  Overall, it was pretty fresh although the tako was extremely fishy.  The food itself I would rate 4/5.\\\\n\\\\nNow let's to get why this experience was horrible: we ordered.  we got our appetizer.  then we waited.  FOR OVER AN HOUR to get our sushi.  I was extremely annoyed with the service.  I guess the other tables all ordered sushi (big surprise since 1/2 the menu is sushi) and the sushi chefs were backed up.  At some point, the waitress did come by to tell us we still had another 20 OR 30 minutes left to wait.  We were already starving at that time.  So she went back to check and confirmed it was still going to take at least 20 minutes.  I was really annoyed that at this point they didn't offer to bring anything in the meantime.  It's not like I was looking for free food but how can you make us wait an hour in between our soup/salad and our entree.  It's also not like we were warned before ordering that it would take so long.  I did end up requesting they bring some like edamame because the wait was so long and the waitress had to 'go and ask' about it.  Eventually, 20 minutes later we were graced with edamame.  Then we had to wait like another 20 minutes to get our sushi.\\\\n\\\\nLike I said, the sushi was good.  But for the horrible service and the $$$, I don't think I'll be coming back.

       "        '***FIRST AND FOREMOST: ONLY THE GOOD REVIEWS ARE POSTED ON BIDDULPH MAZDA\\'S WEBSITE - I POSTED THIS SAME REVIEW ON THEIR SITE AND IT NEVER WENT LIVE***\\\\n\\\\nLess than a year and a half ago (Jan 2011) I purchased a certified pre-owned vehicle from Biddulph Mazda. I felt good about purchasing a car that had been through the claimed 150 point inspection. My salesman Bill was very personable - I have to give him that. He did pull the whole &quot;The guy who put the price on this car made a mistake, it should not be this low...but we have to honor it. Lucky you!&quot; Yeah right. I made them print out the car fax and all of that (which I still have the exact copy they gave me). Everything looked reasonable and good. The car had pin stripes on it that I didn\\'t like, so Bill said I could take the car to a place in Tucson and have the pin stripes removed and then send Biddulph the bill. So the next day I took the car to a place in Tucson to have them removed and the mechanic said, &quot;I can\\'t remove those because the car has been painted. I see paint on top of the stripes, so if I pull those off I have no idea what it\\'s going to look like underneath!&quot; Then we proceeded to remove the bra that had been on the car when I purchased it the day before just to find out that the paint was completely damaged underneath! I called Biddulph and was upset. They told me not to worry and that bras can damage the paint and they will fix it. So I drove the car back and they lent me a car while it was being fixed. When I went back to pick it up, Stephen, who dealt with all of my financing paperwork told me that they couldn\\'t give me the same interest rate because my car was a Mazda RX-8 and the rate couldn\\'t be honored with that model car. He then said, \\\\\"But don\\'t worry! If we extend your finance tearm to longer than 60 months you\\'re payments will actually be less!!\\\\\"; Steve...I\\'m insulted. I told him that I absolutely wanted the monthly payment that I had established when I first signed the paperwork, and I wanted my 60 month term and he had to work his number magic to get my that monthly payment back and I was not going to take the car unless I got that. So Steve apparently worked his magic. At this point I am exhausted with the entire car purchasing process at Biddulph Mazda. Now to get to the main issue. Just recently I was involved in a minor accident that made me take my car into a shop to be fixed through my insurance. The guys at the shop call me and tell me that it is very apparent my car had been in a major accident. They said there is bondo all over the car, it is apparent that the whole roof of the car, the side of the car and the front of the car had been repainted. They also said that my bumber didn\\'t even have the shock absorber...my vehicle was missing an entire part. I went to the shop and took photos of all of their claims. It is very clear to me that had my car gone through the claimed \\\\\"150 Point Inspection - 150 Reasons to Relax\\\\\"; the mechanic at the dealership would have noticed these very obvious issues...and shouldn\\'t they have noticed that the paint under the bra was damaged as well?! Anyway, I called Biddulph the very next day and left a message for Bill and never heard back. Then I called back later the same day and asked to speak to the sales manager. After explaining everything to him, there was quite a moment of silence, and he said that he would be more than happy for me to come trade the car in. Great, however, in August I moved to Houston so I could not bring the car back to the Phoenix area. Out of the question. He then pulled up my paperwork and said that he doesn\\'t see the car was sold as a certified pre-owned vehicle. WHAT! Thank God I kept all of my paperwork. I have a letter from Ron Stettner the Vice President of North American Operations that begins, \\\\\"Dear Megan: Thank you for purchasing a Mazda Certified Pre-Owned Vehicle from Biddulph Mazda. We\\'re confident that your Certified Pre-Owned Mazda will bring you satisfaction and peace of mind on the road ahead...\\\\\" included with a card that has my vehicles VIN number and everything. Another moment of silence from the sales manager. It was Friday and I told him that he had Monday to come up with a solution. It\\'s now Tuesday and I haven\\'t heard back. Bottom line is, I paid money for a car that is NOT the same car I purchased. I believe the dealership is adverstising and misrepresenting cars as certified pre-owned. Please be wary of doing your business there and anywhere for that matter. Always hold on to every piece of paper you get from the dealership, while you\\'re there shopping and after the fact. I am not keeping quiet about this and I am not doing business with Biddulph Mazda ever again.',\n",

The shrimp was sooo... good, I only wish I could have had some more, but with 5 people I didn't move fast enough. The mac and cheese was hot and cheesy- it was everything you could want in a standard mac and cheese. The Hubs had the chicken two ways and has been talking about it days later, so I guess he liked it! Everyone gobbled up the two desserts we shared- the chocolate cake and the cobbler. I was too stuffed to try the cake, but sampled the cobbler and I thought it was pretty good. \\\\n\\\\nAll in all, I was quite pleased with this experience at TK's. The first time I wasn't impressed at all and really didn't want to go back a second time, but I'm glad we did... hopefully they can stay busy since it seems like restaurants are dropping like flies in the area.

We should've picked the table because the service at the bar was horrible. \\\\n\\\\nLet me explain, the bar area holds about 40 people, there were 7 of us around in different area.  We were asked if we wanted bread by the nice counter girl and we said yes.  It took 10 minutes before our waitress actually came over to ask if we wanted to eat and it took the counter person another 5 to bring the bread over. \\\\n\\\\nWe had an app choice and we both chose the New England Clam Chowder!!!  This was the reason for the extra star, the Chowder was amazing. We couldn't stop eating it.  We wanted more but didn't ask as we have crab legs coming.  At the 30 minute mark we got our crab legs.  We had each had one leg and the waitress for some odd reason brought over another full plate for each of us.  It was a nice gesture but why bring over additional legs when we have barely started eating AND they would be cold by the time we got to them. Surprise surprise, when we got to them they were ice cold.  During this entire experience I had 1 glass of water and my friend had 1 diet coke.  That was all we received for the entire hour we were there. Yep, the waitress was off talking to other servers.  I would expect this if she had been slammed with customers but not even close. \\\\n\\\\nWe sat for 10 minutes after we both had finished our meal when she appeared to say she was bringing out our dessert which comes with the Crab Leg meal. \\\\n\\\\nThis was a nice touch as it was a warm banana nut cake with whipped cream.

It wasn\\'t a restaurant I\\'d heard of before and I think I know why. It\\'s not really a proper restaurant! They call themselves a brasserie but it\\'s really part of a small hotel and a bit too out of the way to be convenient. In general, I don\\'t choose to eat at hotels unless they\\'ve got their marketing right and positioned themselves as \\'boutique\\' (Tiger Lily or Le Monde being examples). This place isn\\'t in the same league (not that I\\'m a fan of aforementioned places) although I can see they\\'re trying to be.... its just not quite right...\\\\n\\\\nIn first walking in I waited at the small reception area while the waitress called someone a taxi. I could see into the kitchen which was strange, more so because someone clearly dropped something in there and all I could hear was someone shouting \\\\\"f@ck\\\\\" a lot. More swearing was to follow during the time I stood there. The waitress apologized for the language and hastily took me to my table so I could wait for my friend. The decor was just a little bit wrong. Tablecloths that didn\\'t fit. A weird looking glass cabinet on a bunker that wouldn\\'t look out of place in an old lady tearoom. Bread basket with plastic covering it on display. Scruffy really. \\\\n\\\\nMy voucher basically involved a 3 course meal and a glass of house wine for 2. We got to choose a starter, main and dessert straight from the al a carte which in my vast experience of dining vouchers is unusual but it did give us plenty of choices. \\\\n\\\\nFor starters - My friend went for a warm prawn cocktail and I went for the chicken and wild mushroom terrine. What she got were 5 fat prawns covered in a warm cocktail sauce, but it was only when she tried to unsuccessfully cut into them we realized they still had their shells on. Why would the chef then smother them in sauce?!? Her hands were absolutely covered trying to de-shell these things and when she dipped her hands in the finger bowl provided she screamed out loud as they\\'d given her boiling water! As I am clearly evil, I couldn\\'t help but laugh a little bit - it was just so bizarre! My terrine? Well, it ended up being a massive wedge of p\\\\u00e2t\\\\u00e9. Errrrr, nice but it\\'s not a terrine! \\\\n\\\\nMains - Nicola went for vegetable risotto with a Parmesan crisp. No vegetables in sight, just a fairly bland white risotto. Obviously the chef thought that by making rice with vegetable stock was sufficient enough to call it a vegetable risotto. No Parmesan crisp.... My main was the lamb stew with mashed potato. The mash was dry and lumpy and the lamb severely over cooked with a strange textured sauce, kind of like blitzed carrots or baby food. After a few mouthfuls I gave up. The thing repeated on me for the rest of the evening. Nice. \\\\n\\\\nDessert - the one saving grace (oh, and the Pepper bread which was nice but lacked some butter!) I chose the sticky toffee pudding with ice cream. Clearly a shop bought ice cream but the pudding was actually quite tasty. Nicola went for the mixed fruit creme br\\\\u00fbl\\\\u00e9e and she ate it all so no problems there. \\\\n\\\\nThe service was actually pretty good. Very attentive throughout. I just couldn\\'t bring myself to complain about the food as I\\'d gotten such a cheap deal with the voucher. That was until the owner asked how we enjoyed ourselves on our way out. I swithered but then was like \\\\\"well......\\\\\"  He actually seemed to appreciate the feedback and I was nice about it!

The only thing not quite right was that there was a guy in uniform standing behind the counter, but he looked like he had no clue what was going on at all. He simply stood there not looking at anyone. It did not help that our cashier was rudely barking orders of which donuts to get and what bag to use at him. I am guessing it was his first day? Not sure, but the whole situation was rather uncomfortable. Took my donut and enjoyed it anyway.',\n",
       "        \"This is another staple spot for me in Las Vegas. As I am usually here on business, my company has me stay close to the convention center. Not that I wouldn't make the journey across town to Firefly in any other case, but it is convenient that it is right down Paradise. Here's what's up:\\\\n\\\\nFood: This is a tapas bar. We usually just order like crazy and sample sample sample everything that ends up on the table. Here's the thing: you could throw 10 darts at the menu, order whatever you hit, and you'll be happy. Don't get me wrong there are some things that are better than others but seriously everything is legit. My biggest suggestion are the sliders. \\\\n\\\\nBeverages: Like most places in Vegas, there's no good beer. It's a harsh reality that I have come to except. They have some in between beers and a few good cocktails, but certainly do not come here for the flow of quality liquid.\\\\n\\\\nEnvironment: It makes sense that Firefly has a very Spanish feel to it. It's a tapas bar after all. I'm a fan of how communal the layout is. In the tradition of everyone sharing food, Firefly has a very intimate feel where you are not necessarily 'packed in', but the feeling of being close to everyone promotes the idea of being 'one' and encouraging the idea of sharing. Sort of like most Ethiopian restaurants- where you're all eating from the same plate and the conversations occur in a very raw, intimate setting.\\\\n\\\\nCertainly an 'off strip' gem that is worth checking out. Be prepared to eat lots!\\\\n\\\\nSalud!\",\n",

The second place I stopped was also a bust, they were not open yet. My third and final stop was at No 1 Boba Tea.\\\\n\\\\nWhen I found No 1 Boba Tea (it is inside a mall, can be a little tricky to find), there were other people ahead of me waiting for their drinks so I looked over the menu, even though I knew exactly what I wanted. There were 3 people working but no one acknowledged me until the other customers had paid and left. \\\\n\\\\nI found the menu confusing, it's mainly pictures and very little English. I could tell that #8 was honeydew flavored but I wanted to make sure I got milk tea and not a slushie or smoothie. Sadly the language barrier was too much to overcome, the employee did not understand me when I asked for milk tea. I ended up with a slushie. :( A slushie that should have been mixed better at that!  \\\\n\\\\nOverall, unimpressed. I get better service and drinks at Boba City Cafe.\",\n",

It\\'s predecessor Hello Bistro! is awesome, but not located downtown, unfortunately (yet).  So, off to Toss\\'t I went and I wasn\\'t really disappointed. My salad consisted of romaine hearts, seaweed salad (awesome option), pita chips, strawberries, shrimp and cilantro dressed in a jalapeno dressing.
